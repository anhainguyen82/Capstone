When Andrew realized that new technology like artificial intelligence threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs, he knew he had to do something. In <i>The War on Normal People</i> (2018), he explains the mounting crisis and makes the case for implementing a universal basic income: $1,000 a month for every American adult, no strings attached.\\n</div><div></div><br/>\\n<div>You can learn more about the campaign at Yang2020.com, or listening to Andrew on the Joe Rogan Experience.</div><div><br/>\\n</div><div>\\nEvery campaign claims to be data driven.
