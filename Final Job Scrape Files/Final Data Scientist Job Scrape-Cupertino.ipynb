We are growing rapidly and need great people to generate analytical insights to understand our product and customers.\\n\\nWhat does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem.

We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.\\n\\nWe are looking for team members that love new challenges, cracking tough problems and working cross-functionally.
