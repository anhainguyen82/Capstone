       "19  The Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California (USC) invites applications for a Statistician I position as part of a large national research program called Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO). The goal of ECHO is to capitalize on existing study populations to investigate environmental exposures on child health and development, with a particular focus on airways, obesity, neurodevelopment and pre-, peri- and postnatal health. This position involves analysis of large epidemiologic datasets from two large, ongoing cohorts, the Children’s Health Study (CHS) and the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) pregnancy cohort. This is an opportunity to work with world-class investigators from two closely integrated Centers at USC: the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center (SCEHSC), a research center funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) Center, a research center funded by the NIEHS, NIMHD and the EPA. The SCEHSC houses one of the leading research groups in environmental epidemiology and biostatistics, with a particularly strong reputation in respiratory and metabolic diseases as well as methodological research in environmental and genetic epidemiology. The MADRES Center is investigating the role of prenatal environmental exposures and social determinants of the development of childhood obesity as well as other metabolic and respiratory health outcomes. Specifically, the position will:\\nManage and integrate data from multiple sources and databases including REDCap, eLAB, Excel, SAS and SQL;\\nClean and process data on longitudinal outcomes and measures;\\nPerform quality control on code and/or analyses provided by others;\\nConduct data harmonization and analysis on longitudinal and cross-sectional data sets;\\nMaintain documentation of analytic decisions and procedures;\\nAssist in interpretation of large epidemiologic data sets;\\nContribute to the writing and preparation of reports, journal articles and conference presentations; and\\nAssist in the development of research proposals.\\nThe ideal candidate must have solid proficiency in SAS programming, including data manipulation and analysis procedures. Master’s degree in biostatistics, epidemiology, or a related field is required. Candidates must be detail-oriented, fluent in English, and possess excellent organizational, communication, and written skills.\\nMinimum Education: Master's degree, Combined experience/education as substitute for minimum education Minimum Experience: 2 years, Combined education/experience as substitute for minimum experience Minimum Field of Expertise: Biometry, Biostatistics or Statistics; mainframe computer and PC experience; experience with SAS, Epilog, BMDP, GLIM or SPSS.
