Our Pulse Platform is used to engage with populations around the world to provide insight into their thinking and engaging them in a two-way conversation.

Here are the Values we subscribe to as an organization and if they resonate with you and you have the appropriate skills and experience, you’re encouraged to apply.\\n\"Afghanistan + Burning Man\"\\nAt IST we do some really weird stuff. We are operating in parts of the world that no one else is operating. We seek teammates that can take off their western lens and operate as \"good strangers\" around the world. There is a serious focus on Hospitality in the Afghan culture that we want to embrace as we travel the world and welcome others to our spaces. Burning Man's self-reliance, civic responsibility, and participation principles ring true for us here.\\n\"Sledge Hammer\"\\nBe prepared to deliver impact like a sledgehammer; we do not work on easy problems or answer trivial questions. We are fighting human trafficking, battling propaganda machines, and bypassing oppressive regimes. The pace at IST Research is intense and we have found that it really isn't for everyone. These waters are deep, fast, and wide. If you can’t swim at the outset, you’ll drown. If you can swim, you’ll be fine-and you’ll get better at swimming as the time goes on, we are teammates counting on each other all of the time.\\n\"No Other Room\"\\nWe often assume that our good ideas must, surely, not be original; that someone else must be currently working on the same thing and that somewhere there is a room full of very smart people working to solve this problem right now. Over and over we have proven to ourselves that there is no other room. We are the team that break open communications in the hardest to reach parts of the world and start conversations with the most vulnerable populations to improve their lives.\\n\"Lewis and Clark\"\\nCharting your own path is the name of the game at IST Research. As an extreme meritocracy, there is no pre-described career path here. Your path is the one you create through your own efforts and ideas. Our goal is to find teammates that are fearless explorers and then allow them to chart their own course. We function in an interesting combination of ambiguity and autonomy. We want you to chart your own path without fear of micromanaging. Blazing your own trail is not only allowed, it's encouraged.\\n\"Addams Family\"\\nOur HQ is in a big old house (might be haunted) in Historic Fredericksburg and the people of the company behave (and sometimes misbehave) like a family. We are diverse in habit and thought, but the diversity makes us stronger. There is much wrapped up in this value but think about the raw, honest conversations that happen around the dinner table, the unwavering support you get during trying times, the chaos surrounding large family events, and the fact that sometimes you just have to do some things that aren't your favorite but the family needs it done.\\n\\nAwards\\n\\n\\nIST Research has been recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of the Fastest Growing Companies 3 years in a row - https://www.inc.com/profile/ist-research as well as being honored as an Inc. Magazine ‘Best Workplaces’ winner - https://www.inc.com/profile/ist-research-corp\\n\\nLearn more at: https://www.istresearch.com IST Research is an equal opportunity employer.
