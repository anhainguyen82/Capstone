-----------

We are seeking a creative and collaborative computer scientist, statistician, or computational geneticist for a role on our computational genomics team. The team is building a novel platform to identify the molecular circuits underpinning complex human disease, by combining human genetics data with our proprietary single-cell transcriptomics and neuroanatomical tracing data. The group is applying recent breakthroughs in proteomics, next-generation sequencing, network biology, epigenetics, and computational genomics, in order to map the genetic correlates of disease discovered from human genetics studies onto a biological network representing the gut-brain axis. The platform we are building includes proprietary developments in statistical fine-mapping; the application of cell-type-specific epigenetics data; population genetics; the use of predictive deep learning algorithms; and biological networks.

Successful candidates will have a strong background in mathematics and computer science, together with some exposure to biology or genetics, and the personal and technical skills required on a large software engineering effort. Candidates should have a track record of developing sophisticated new mathematical or computational methods, ideally paired with experience working collaboratively on a shared codebase with other scientists or engineers. The ability to transition from academics to industry is a paramount requirement, even though much of our computational genomics work is experimental in nature. The successful candidate will be a team player, whose ideas and contributions are focused on the team's specific objectives.

Opportunities for PhD-level internships on the computational genomics team are also available.

Key Responsibilities
--------------------


Work on a small, highly collaborative team to develop the mathematical theory and software that comprise our human genetics analysis platform

Document new theoretical approaches in LaTeX; contribute to writing manuscripts for internal circulation and publication
Critically assess current state-of-the-art methods in computational genomics; stay abreast of new developments
Generate novel ideas to improve our human genetics strategy or the speed with which we implement it
Participate in code reviews (as both reviewer and author); software deployment and testing; iteration planning and timeline estimation; and software design discussions

Qualifications and Education Requirements
-----------------------------------------

You must have:

Ph.D. in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Computational Genomics, or Statistical Genetics
Raw intelligence and an eagerness to learn
Experience working collaboratively on a shared scientific codebase
Deep programming experience in a mathematical or object-oriented language
Commitment to rigor, in both quantitative analysis and software development
Excellent communication and interpersonal skills (the role requires communicating about complex biological and computational issues)
An understanding of major biological and/or genetic concepts
