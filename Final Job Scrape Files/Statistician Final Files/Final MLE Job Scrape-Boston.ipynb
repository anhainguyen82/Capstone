       "      <td>Harvard Medical School and Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital\\nPostdoctoral Position in Computational Neuroscience\\n\\nA Postdoctoral Position in Computational Neurology is available at the Neurogenomics Laboratory (www.scherzerlaboratory.org) of Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Principal Investigator: Dr. Clemens Scherzer) with additional affiliations in the Precision Neurology Program and the Advanced Center for Parkinson's Disease Research (www.bwhparkinsoncenter.org). This fully funded position is available for an initial two-year appointment with the possibility of extension. The Neurogenomics Lab is interdisciplinary - located at the intersection of genomics, computing, and neurology.\\n\\nThe goal of the Neurogenomics Lab is to decipher how the human genome programs brain cells and to determine how the normal flow of genetic information is impaired in Parkinson’s and other brain diseases. We are building a personalized medicine for neurologic disease that harnesses genomic information to diagnose and treat the right patient with the right drug at the right time. Two of the major ongoing projects are BRAINCODE (see Dong et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2018) for phase 1 results and the International Genetics of Parkinson Progression (IGPP) Consortium (see Liu et al., Lancet Neurology, 2017; Liu et al., Annals of Neurology, 2016).\\n\\nDecoding human brain cells in health and disease: The BRAINcode project’s goal is to chart the flow of information from the entire human genome into specific brain cells in health and brain disease. Genetic variation between hundreds of individuals is examined for correlation with differences in transcribed elements-both protein-coding and non-coding-to identify regions of the genome that influence whether, how, and how much a transcript is expressed in this specific cell type in situ in human brains. Transcriptomes of control and diseased brains are probed using single-cell RNAseq, as well as lcRNAseq (that is laser-capture microdissection plus ultra deep, total RNA sequencing), SNP arrays, expression Quantitative Trait Locus analysis, and epigenetics. BRAINCODE will provide a high-resolution encyclopedia of transcribed elements in prototype cell-types in human brains, help to understand inherited susceptibility to Parkinson's and other neuropsychiatric disease, and highlight targets for precision therapies.\\n\\nPredicting the future of patients with Parkinson's disease: The progression of Parkinson’s disease varies considerably between individual patients, ranging from a manageable functional decline to an aggressive course that leaves patients rapidly wheelchair bound or demented. This variation is a major source of noise and inefficiency in therapeutic trials. Predictors of progression are needed for tailored therapeutic trials and for precision medicine. In this project we are using next-generation genetics to delineate the genetic landscape of prognosis in patients with PD.\\n\\nYou will join our computational neuroscience team comprising bioinformatics engineers, Fellows, students, and a statistician, and benefit from our integrated wet lab and translational research in our program.\\n\\nYour tasks: We are looking for enthusiastic, highly motivated, science-driven and experienced postdoctoral fellows to join our team to unravel how the genome functions in the human brain and in patients with Parkinson’s using next generation genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, network analysis, and data science. Moreover, you will participate in exome and whole genome sequencing studies designed to identify gene variants that predict prognosis in patients with Parkinson’s.\\nSalary will be commensurate with experience.\\nApplication deadline: August 31, 2019\\n\\n\\nQualifications\\n\\nYour qualifications: Applicants are expected to have (1) A previous publication as first author is desirable, (2) Ph. D. or equivalent doctoral degree with (3) proven research experience in bioinformatics and analyses of genome-wide data (for example, single cell RNA sequencing, GWAS, eQTL, AI methods, ATAC seq, whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq, epigenetics, eQTL). (4) Strong quantitative skills preferably in computer science, bioinformatics, or statistics are necessary. Programming background is desirable. Excellent written English is advantageous. Candidates working towards an academic career in computational neuroscience and PD are preferred.\\n\\nHow to apply: Please submit your application, including a statement of research interests, a biosketch, and one letter of reference to Clemens Scherzer at cscherzer@rics.bwh.harvard.edu.\\n\\nEEO Statement\\n\\nBrigham and Women’s Hospital is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

       "4   Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women’s Hospital\\nPostdoctoral Position in Computational Neuroscience\\n\\nA Postdoctoral Position in Computational Neurology is available at the Neurogenomics Laboratory (www.scherzerlaboratory.org) of Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Principal Investigator: Dr. Clemens Scherzer) with additional affiliations in the Precision Neurology Program and the Advanced Center for Parkinson's Disease Research (www.bwhparkinsoncenter.org). This fully funded position is available for an initial two-year appointment with the possibility of extension. The Neurogenomics Lab is interdisciplinary - located at the intersection of genomics, computing, and neurology.\\n\\nThe goal of the Neurogenomics Lab is to decipher how the human genome programs brain cells and to determine how the normal flow of genetic information is impaired in Parkinson’s and other brain diseases. We are building a personalized medicine for neurologic disease that harnesses genomic information to diagnose and treat the right patient with the right drug at the right time. Two of the major ongoing projects are BRAINCODE (see Dong et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2018) for phase 1 results and the International Genetics of Parkinson Progression (IGPP) Consortium (see Liu et al., Lancet Neurology, 2017; Liu et al., Annals of Neurology, 2016).\\n\\nDecoding human brain cells in health and disease: The BRAINcode project’s goal is to chart the flow of information from the entire human genome into specific brain cells in health and brain disease. Genetic variation between hundreds of individuals is examined for correlation with differences in transcribed elements-both protein-coding and non-coding-to identify regions of the genome that influence whether, how, and how much a transcript is expressed in this specific cell type in situ in human brains. Transcriptomes of control and diseased brains are probed using single-cell RNAseq, as well as lcRNAseq (that is laser-capture microdissection plus ultra deep, total RNA sequencing), SNP arrays, expression Quantitative Trait Locus analysis, and epigenetics. BRAINCODE will provide a high-resolution encyclopedia of transcribed elements in prototype cell-types in human brains, help to understand inherited susceptibility to Parkinson's and other neuropsychiatric disease, and highlight targets for precision therapies.\\n\\nPredicting the future of patients with Parkinson's disease: The progression of Parkinson’s disease varies considerably between individual patients, ranging from a manageable functional decline to an aggressive course that leaves patients rapidly wheelchair bound or demented. This variation is a major source of noise and inefficiency in therapeutic trials. Predictors of progression are needed for tailored therapeutic trials and for precision medicine. In this project we are using next-generation genetics to delineate the genetic landscape of prognosis in patients with PD.\\n\\nYou will join our computational neuroscience team comprising bioinformatics engineers, Fellows, students, and a statistician, and benefit from our integrated wet lab and translational research in our program.\\n\\nYour tasks: We are looking for enthusiastic, highly motivated, science-driven and experienced postdoctoral fellows to join our team to unravel how the genome functions in the human brain and in patients with Parkinson’s using next generation genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, network analysis, and data science. Moreover, you will participate in exome and whole genome sequencing studies designed to identify gene variants that predict prognosis in patients with Parkinson’s.\\nSalary will be commensurate with experience.\\nApplication deadline: August 31, 2019\\n\\n\\nQualifications\\n\\nYour qualifications: Applicants are expected to have (1) A previous publication as first author is desirable, (2) Ph.

Chan School of Public Health, is an ongoing cohort of nurses and nursing students residing in the U.S. and Canada that is actively enrolling new participants. Participation involves primarily completing web-based questionnaires. Our current focus is on increasing enrollment, maintaining our high participant follow-up rates, and ensuring smooth roll out of follow-up to participants. Additionally, we are expanding into the collection of biological and environmental samples in select sub-sets of participants. Therefore, we are seeking a Statistical Analyst/Programmer with excellent attention to detail and experience working in various computing environments. The Statistical Analyst/Programmer will serve as the primary programming contact for programming staff at related cohorts for investigators working with NHS3 data, will be responsible for data management operations of the cohort, and will support study investigators in data analysis tasks.

       "10  Company Summary:\\nDeciphera Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients by tackling key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. Our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a “switched off” or inactivated conformation. These investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. We have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate and/or durability of their responses to treatment.\\n\\nWe offer an outstanding culture and opportunity for personal and professional growth based on these key principles: providing a collaborative, energized and fun work environment where people are empowered and supported in the achievement of their career goals a diverse and multi-disciplinary workforce dedicated and talented people who are passionate about achieving excellence in all they do a work environment that allows you to balance your priorities above all else, a commitment to the patients we serve\\n\\nWe are seeking an Associate Director to the Biostatistics group.\\n\\nThis position will report to the Senior Director, Biostatistics and Data Management and be located in the Waltham, MA office.\\nKey Responsibilities\\nServe as a lead statistician and manage statistical efforts for multiple clinical studies and/or a clinical program\\nContribute to clinical protocol development, including authoring of the section on statistical methods and reviewing/editing of other sections by applying statistical principles\\nAuthor statistical analysis plans for studies and/or ISS/ISEs, and author/edit shells for tables, figures and listings\\nReview CRF designs to ensure data collection meet the study objectives and the requirements of statistical analyses\\nProvide statistical input to data monitoring committee (DMC) charters, project management plan, and other study-level documents\\nWork with statistical programmers or CROs to generate tables, figures and listings\\nPerform ad hoc and exploratory statistical analyses as needed\\nContribute to clinical study reports, including authoring of statistical sections and interpretation of the study results\\nSupport regulatory submissions as needed; provide response to regulatory requests independently\\nSupport the preparation of publications, including manuscripts, posters and oral presentations\\nProvide oversight of CROs for outsourced statistical activities and QC key results generated by CROs\\nMay have director reports\\nRequired Qualifications\\nPhD in statistics or a related field with at least 6 years of relevant clinical trial experience or MS in statistics or equivalent with at least 8 years of relevant clinical trial experience\\nKnowledge of statistical methods for clinical trials\\nIn-depth Knowledge of FDA, EMA and ICH regulations and guidelines\\nProficient in statistical programming (SAS is required)\\nExperience with trial design software (e.g., EAST or nQuery)\\nGood communication skills and ability to work with cross-functional study teams\\nGood organizational skills, sufficient to multi-task in an extremely fast-paced environment with changing priorities\\nGood analytical and problem-solving skills\\nPositive and collaborative attitude\\nPreferred Qualifications\\nExperience with NDAs/BLAs, MAAs and other regulatory submissions is a plus\\nProficient in running simulations using either SAS or R\\nIn providing information about work experience in the application process, a candidate may include any verified work performed on a volunteer basis.
