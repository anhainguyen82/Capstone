",None Found,"DENVER CHRISTIAN ATHLETIC PHILOSOPHY
Interscholastic athletics are an integral part of a Denver Christian education. Denver Christian School is dedicated to providing a Christ-centered education that develops the whole child; this includes developing the academic, social/emotional, spiritual, creative/artistic, and kinesthetic/athletic. In order to glorify God in athletics, our athletes must pursue the goal of excellence within a Christian framework. The success of our athletic program is more than the outcome of a competition between two different schools; it means capturing every aspect of athletics (practice, traveling, competing, etc.) as an opportunity for learning, physical development, and discipleship. As Christians, we are called to excellence (performance to the best of our ability) in all areas of life because God rules over every area of our life … including athletics, and He has given us gifts to use for His glory.
ATHLETIC GOALS
Denver Christian provides the opportunity for our students to participate in athletics:
To help our students understand that God is in every part of their lives, whether that is in the classroom, on the athletic field, or in their home life.
To develop physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, recognizing that each individual student is a unique creation of God.
To provide athletic experiences where our teams participate in such a way that we honor our God, our school, our team, and our community.
To develop our students into athletes who play fairly, observe regulations and policies, treat other with courtesy and take adversity without complaining.
To demonstrate respect and courtesy toward teammates, opponents, and officials at all times.
To help our students gain experience through athletic participation that will develop Christian character and reflect Christ to others.
To help our students understand that our motto “TO GOD BE THE GLORY” is achieved when God is glorified through our effort, attitude, and performance. Our teams will train hard to win without submitting to the “win at all costs” view that is so prevalent in today’s culture.
COACH EXPECTATIONS
Athletics is one of the many means of discipleship DC uses to bring students to a deeper relationship with Christ. Participating in a sport provides daily opportunities for students to grow in their walk with Christ by experiencing struggles, failure, success, and relationships through a Biblical framework. Coaches are the primary guide throughout this process. At all times, coaches should represent Christ, the school, and themselves in a way that honors God. Coaches are called to teach their athletes to do the same. In addition to discipleship, coaches must demonstrate excellence in their field and a growth mindset to be ever improving.
Coaches should have a clear profession of their faith in Christ and a discipling attitude about coaching/athletics
Coaches must have demonstrated knowledge of the game either as a player or as a coach; varsity coaches must have successful prior coaching experience.
