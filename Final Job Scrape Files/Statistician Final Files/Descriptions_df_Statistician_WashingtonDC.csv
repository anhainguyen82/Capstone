IST Research Values

At IST Research, culture is a driving force and culture fit is a critical aspect of candidate selection and success. Here are the Values we subscribe to as an organization and if they resonate with you and you have the appropriate skills and experience, you’re encouraged to apply.
""Afghanistan + Burning Man""
At IST we do some really weird stuff. We are operating in parts of the world that no one else is operating. We seek teammates that can take off their western lens and operate as ""good strangers"" around the world. There is a serious focus on Hospitality in the Afghan culture that we want to embrace as we travel the world and welcome others to our spaces. Burning Man's self-reliance, civic responsibility, and participation principles ring true for us here.
""Sledge Hammer""
Be prepared to deliver impact like a sledgehammer; we do not work on easy problems or answer trivial questions. We are fighting human trafficking, battling propaganda machines, and bypassing oppressive regimes. The pace at IST Research is intense and we have found that it really isn't for everyone. These waters are deep, fast, and wide. If you can’t swim at the outset, you’ll drown. If you can swim, you’ll be fine-and you’ll get better at swimming as the time goes on, we are teammates counting on each other all of the time.
""No Other Room""
We often assume that our good ideas must, surely, not be original; that someone else must be currently working on the same thing and that somewhere there is a room full of very smart people working to solve this problem right now. Over and over we have proven to ourselves that there is no other room. We are the team that break open communications in the hardest to reach parts of the world and start conversations with the most vulnerable populations to improve their lives.
""Lewis and Clark""
Charting your own path is the name of the game at IST Research. As an extreme meritocracy, there is no pre-described career path here. Your path is the one you create through your own efforts and ideas. Our goal is to find teammates that are fearless explorers and then allow them to chart their own course. We function in an interesting combination of ambiguity and autonomy. We want you to chart your own path without fear of micromanaging. Blazing your own trail is not only allowed, it's encouraged.
""Addams Family""
Our HQ is in a big old house (might be haunted) in Historic Fredericksburg and the people of the company behave (and sometimes misbehave) like a family. We are diverse in habit and thought, but the diversity makes us stronger. There is much wrapped up in this value but think about the raw, honest conversations that happen around the dinner table, the unwavering support you get during trying times, the chaos surrounding large family events, and the fact that sometimes you just have to do some things that aren't your favorite but the family needs it done.

At the core of our advanced analytics are our research scientists - designing, implementing, and deploying innovative solutions to a wide range of problems, such as predicting government action, analyzing the impact of regulations, creating networks of relationships, extracting patterns from web content, and modeling user behavior to personalize content relevance. Because we’re always identifying newer and more complex problems, we’re on the lookout for research scientists who thrive in environments catering to applicable analysis by day, and shoot-for-the-moon risk taking by night. You’ll lead the way in all stages of researching and developing insightful and actionable models and analysis, looking into the future and becoming an internal and external expert.

You Will:
Explore new data sources for integration with current data and new types of analysisDesign experiments, prototype new types of models, enhance existing onesCollaborate with engineering to build out analysisCreate and collaborate on narratives from the data, including interesting trends, insights for presentation on and off the application

You Have:
1-3+ years of practical experience in one or more of the following:
1. Machine Learning: linear models, deep learning, graphical models, bayesian modeling, supervised/unsupervised learning, content personalization
2. Natural Language Processing: applications of ML to NLP, information extraction and retrieval, search, automated content generation, multilingual systems
3. Computational Social Science: policy/legislative/regulatory analysis, comparative politics, financial analysis

About You
You're a computer scientist looking to make an impact, a political scientist with a computational bend, an economist or statistician that yearns for more kinds of data, a machine learning specialist that wants to push the boundaries, or maybe even a physicist or mathematician who's making a transition. In any case, you become uncomfortable when you don’t understand something, and choose to relentlessly seek out solutions rather than ever give up. You’re guided equally by your own intuition and delivering the best results to the customer. You’re comfortable around ambiguity with a high degree of autonomy, and are excited about solving complex, open-ended problems by distilling the complexity as simply as necessary to build solutions that work. Along the way, you’re capable of communicating what you’re thinking to both technical and non-technical audiences, taking in others’ ideas as well as expressing your own. Interested in both theory and application, you’re equally up for creating a novel model, as well as working with product managers or journalists to define impactful problems and engineering teams to productionize it. You’ve built or deployed statistical solutions, especially involving NLP and ML, and are excited about productionizing research to push the bounds of people’s expectations.
