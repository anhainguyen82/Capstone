46,DATA SCIENTIST / MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER,"Pittsburgh, PA",Pittsburgh,PA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"COMPANY VISION
The world has seen tremendous growth in products that combine data from embedded sensors to perform intelligent functions. This functionality has enabled us to interface more naturally with our devices and has also improved our lives by alerting us to dangers or maintenance needs (e.g. biosensors, alarms, equipment condition monitoring). While enhancing the user-experience, these always-sensing products are also a major contributor to ""big data"" as they improve the way we exercise, communicate, secure our homes, monitor our health, and maintain our equipment. One of the big challenges device manufacturers face is to meet the market demand for untethered always-sensing products by porting this always-sensing functionality from corded products to battery-operated products without sacrificing sensing capabilities and maintaining reasonable battery-life and keeping data to a manageable level.
Aspinity's unique analog processor marks a paradigm shift in the way data is collected. Just as the brain makes sense of its multi-modal sensory input by focusing higher-order cognition on salient characteristics, Aspinity enables developers to extract ""sense"" from sensors before the data is even digitized, which reduces power consumption and allows the system to focus compute resources on relevant information. With already established applications to voice control, sound classification, machinery monitoring, and distributed power grid monitoring, Aspinity's programmable analog processing technology is positioned to be the key abstraction layer for the physical world at a time when new user interface paradigms (touch to voice to …) and new monitoring capabilities are transforming industries. Join us as we build a new sensing framework!
POSITION DESCRIPTION
Aspinity is looking for an experienced data scientist to support optimization of algorithms and architectures for Aspinity's revolutionary analog processor solution. You will be responsible to create training frameworks for end-customers and tools for internal product optimization.

Develop and integrate into SDK easy-to-use frameworks for training algorithms to run on RAMP IC
Improve training algorithms that target unique analog processor solution
Develop tools for analyzing results of hardware model experiments on large datasets to support performance optimization
Develop tools for system-level optimization of analog/digital/cloud partitioning to minimize overall power consumption
Develop and test signal processing libraries and applications for RAMP IC
Collect and analyze IC resource utilization in delivered algorithms to support IC architecture optimization
Interface with customers/partners to support system optimization with 3rd party data
Be ""voice of customer"" on SDK requirements and contribute to SDK development
REQUIREMENTS:
MSEE/CPE/CS degree with ~5 years of relevant industry experience in data science, machine learning, and signal processing
Expert in Python/Octave/Matlab/R with experience in applied ML, ML theory, large datasets, real-world sensor data
Experience with signal processing—including machine learning, signal detection, and optimization techniques; Experience with analog signal processing is a plus
Experience in one or more of the following sensor application areas: audio/voice, vibration monitoring, touch/proximity, biosensing, electric/magnetic fields

We apply scientific rigor and creativity, succeeding where others may fail, and we invest in our communities, making the world better for generations to come. All of us share a common purpose: to solve the greatest challenges of today and tomorrow.

Our 22,000 employees work at the forefront of scientific innovation to tackle critical challenges in security, human health, manufacturing, energy and environmental management. Battelle’s work is grounded in the belief that science, technology and a passion for excellence can make industries more competitive and the world a better place.

We are currently seeking a Machine Learning Researcher. This position located in Pittsburgh, PA.

Primary Function
We are seeking a researcher with experience in CFD and machine learning (ML). The objective of this work is to accelerate CFD using the latest technological developments in ML and associated hardware. More specifically, the leading code for ML, Google’s TensorFlow™, will be linked to NETL’s MFiX and the solvers will be augmented/replaced with machine learned or hybrid algorithms which significantly accelerate computational speed without sacrificing accuracy. The primary challenge in this work is developing the ML algorithms that can be generalizable, accurate enough, and fast enough to be useful. This requires a substantial amount of data and the right model forms, as well as computing resources to train the models. The work also requires intimate knowledge of the workings of ML and data science. Having a strong background in the workings of CFD is not enough; therefore, we need individuals with ML and data science backgrounds. For analytical CFD, ML algorithms are not likely to be accurate enough on their own. Therefore, hybrid algorithms are likely to be key to development.
Major Responsibilities
Assisting in developing ML models that solve systems ordinary differential equations/partial differential equations (ODE/PDEs) in less time to a given accuracy than the competitive iterative solvers.
Implementing TensorFlow™ based solvers to refine machine learned initial guesses as needed.
Benchmarking the new solvers on a variety of the latest hardware for ML models and compare to the traditional solution methods.
Presenting ideas and results to the research team.
Contributing to future research planning and assisting with proposals.
Working independently and collaboratively with members of the research team to meet milestones and deliverables.
Assisting or leading efforts in writing research papers and creating conference presentations.
Position Requirements
THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:

A B.S. or advanced degree in computer science, mathematics, or engineering, or a related field.
Two or more years of prior relevant experience with CFD code development.
Knowledge of how the matrices and source terms in CFD are formed for finite volume methods.
THE FOLLOWING IS DESIRED, BUT NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:

Experience in and a strong knowledge of Python™.
Machine Learning (ML) in TensorFlow™ knowledge.
CFD experience using NETL’s MFiX software.
