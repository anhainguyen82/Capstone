       "      <td>Overview\\nWe are looking for a high performing data scientist for our Quickbooks Capital business. QuickBooks Capital is a nimble and high-priority start-up within Intuit that is looking to reinvent small business borrowing and we are the team responsible for using our data to answer the most critical questions facing the Capital Product Managers. We are growing rapidly and need great people to generate analytical insights to understand our product and customers.\\n\\nWhat does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.\\n\\nWe are looking for team members that love new challenges, cracking tough problems and working cross-functionally. If you are looking to join a fast-paced, innovative and incredibly fun team go check out the product (quickbookscapital.com) and if you find this exciting, then we look forward to hearing from you!\\nResponsibilities\\nBe an analytical thought partner to the business, using data to influence the future direction of the business\\nSolve product analytics problems by doing work such as developing data structures, pipelines, and data visualizations that enable us to find insights and take action by working with click data, event data, user provided data, third party data, risk data and more\\nPerform analyses that inform decisions on everything from retention strategy to product experience using predictive and descriptive analytical techniques\\nCommunicate findings from analyses in a way that enables business leaders to make better decisions\\nPartner with product analysts and engineers to understand the product roadmap and institute tracking for new features\\nAbility to help design and execute product experiments through A/B testing\\nChampion data-driven decision-making in your team and throughout the company, including coaching and mentoring others on best practices\\nQualifications\\n5+ years of experience in generating and sharing insights from product data\\nFluency in data analysis, including defining KPIs, statistical and predictive modeling concepts, descriptive statistics, experimental design and A/B testing\\nExceptional SQL skills, some form of coding (Python, Scala, R etc.), and ETL/scheduling tools such as Airflow/Tidal\\nExperience with data visualization tools such as Tableau etc.\\nExperience working with SaaS-based subscription metrics including conversion, retention and product usage is preferred\\nEntrepreneurial spirit and passionate about data\\nUndergrad Degree in a Quantitative Field (Masters preferred)</td>\n",

Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.\\nWe are looking for strong Data Scientists to join our AI Data Science and Analytics team in Menlo Park, to focus on AI Models Measurement. The team’s mission is to understand and measure the impact of our AI systems for any product use-case. Currently, most innovations in our AI technologies (Vision, Speech, Language) are measured against external datasets. While useful for understanding our performance relative to external systems, these external benchmarks are problematic because they may not represent performance on Facebook specific use-cases (because of differences in data content, deployment, pre-processing, etc.). Furthermore, for our biggest AI platforms around Video, Speech and Language understanding we typically measure impact of major changes only at the model level and not at the product level. This means that while our technologies may generally advance, it's not well-understood what specific improvements these changes drive for Facebook, except for on an ad hoc basis. The team is building an internal benchmarking platform that provides Facebook specific data, models and metrics for AI researchers, engineers and product managers to guide their decisions.\\n\\nYou will be responsible to help define the methodologies and metrics relevant in building an AI Model Measurement platform. This role works closely with both product and engineering teams to help define and execute on opportunities to improve and expand AI and ML model benchmarking. Successful candidates for this role will have a background in a quantitative or technical field, will have experience with the lifecycle of machine learning model development and production deployment, statistical methodologies and working with large data sets, and will have experience in influencing decision making across different teams through data.\\nRESPONSIBILITIES\\nApply your strong analytical skills to gain deep insights into the data and ML model performance, and be able to clearly present your results and help guide cross-functional partners\\nDefine problems and opportunities in a complex or ambiguous area\\nInform, influence, support, and execute our product decisions and product launches\\nPartner with Product and Engineering teams to solve problems and identify new levers to improve model performance and user experience\\nInfluencing the roadmap and decisions made by the machine translation team through presentation of data-based recommendations, and clearly communicating the state of the machine translation effort, experiment results, etc. to product teams\\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\\nMS degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. statistics, operations research, econometrics), or BS in a quantitative discipline with MBA with a quantitative concentration (operations management, supply chain, information technology, finance), or equivalent experience\\n5+ years experience doing quantitative analysis or statistical modeling\\nTrack-record driving product strategy through data analysis and product positioning\\nExperience extracting and manipulating large datasets\\nWorking knowledge of at least one modeling framework (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SAS, R, MATLAB)\\nCommunication experience\\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\\nExperience with the lifecycle of machine learning model development and productization and advanced statistical techniques (e.g. causal inference)\\nExperience in statistical analysis of machine learning or deep learning performance\\nFacebook is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.

You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.\\n\\nIn early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.\\n\\nWe're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.\\n\\nWe are currently accepting applications for a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing.
