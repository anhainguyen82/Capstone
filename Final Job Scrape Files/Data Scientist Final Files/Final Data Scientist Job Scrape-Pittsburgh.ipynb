       "      <td>COMPANY VISION\\nThe world has seen tremendous growth in products that combine data from embedded sensors to perform intelligent functions. This functionality has enabled us to interface more naturally with our devices and has also improved our lives by alerting us to dangers or maintenance needs (e.g. biosensors, alarms, equipment condition monitoring). While enhancing the user-experience, these always-sensing products are also a major contributor to \"big data\" as they improve the way we exercise, communicate, secure our homes, monitor our health, and maintain our equipment. One of the big challenges device manufacturers face is to meet the market demand for untethered always-sensing products by porting this always-sensing functionality from corded products to battery-operated products without sacrificing sensing capabilities and maintaining reasonable battery-life and keeping data to a manageable level.\\nAspinity's unique analog processor marks a paradigm shift in the way data is collected. Just as the brain makes sense of its multi-modal sensory input by focusing higher-order cognition on salient characteristics, Aspinity enables developers to extract \"sense\" from sensors before the data is even digitized, which reduces power consumption and allows the system to focus compute resources on relevant information. With already established applications to voice control, sound classification, machinery monitoring, and distributed power grid monitoring, Aspinity's programmable analog processing technology is positioned to be the key abstraction layer for the physical world at a time when new user interface paradigms (touch to voice to …) and new monitoring capabilities are transforming industries. Join us as we build a new sensing framework!\\nPOSITION DESCRIPTION\\nAspinity is looking for an experienced data scientist to support optimization of algorithms and architectures for Aspinity's revolutionary analog processor solution. You will be responsible to create training frameworks for end-customers and tools for internal product optimization.\\nROLE &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES:\\nDevelop and integrate into SDK easy-to-use frameworks for training algorithms to run on RAMP IC\\nImprove training algorithms that target unique analog processor solution\\nDevelop tools for analyzing results of hardware model experiments on large datasets to support performance optimization\\nDevelop tools for system-level optimization of analog/digital/cloud partitioning to minimize overall power consumption\\nDevelop and test signal processing libraries and applications for RAMP IC\\nCollect and analyze IC resource utilization in delivered algorithms to support IC architecture optimization\\nInterface with customers/partners to support system optimization with 3rd party data\\nBe \"voice of customer\" on SDK requirements and contribute to SDK development\\nREQUIREMENTS:\\nMSEE/CPE/CS degree with ~5 years of relevant industry experience in data science, machine learning, and signal processing\\nExpert in Python/Octave/Matlab/R with experience in applied ML, ML theory, large datasets, real-world sensor data\\nExperience with signal processing—including machine learning, signal detection, and optimization techniques; Experience with analog signal processing is a plus\\nExperience in one or more of the following sensor application areas: audio/voice, vibration monitoring, touch/proximity, biosensing, electric/magnetic fields\\nStrong problem-solving skills and experience working in a fast-paced collaborative environment; Able to adapt to change quickly and effectively—including prioritizing tasks\\nStrong on attention to detail and making sure issues and tasks get followed through to completion\\nOTHER INFORMATION:\\nLocated in Pittsburgh, PA (preferred)\\n9VtrKQA89b</td>\n",

We apply scientific rigor and creativity, succeeding where others may fail, and we invest in our communities, making the world better for generations to come. All of us share a common purpose: to solve the greatest challenges of today and tomorrow.\\n\\nOur 22,000 employees work at the forefront of scientific innovation to tackle critical challenges in security, human health, manufacturing, energy and environmental management. Battelle’s work is grounded in the belief that science, technology and a passion for excellence can make industries more competitive and the world a better place.\\n\\nWe are currently seeking a Machine Learning Researcher. This position located in Pittsburgh, PA.\\n\\nPrimary Function\\nWe are seeking a researcher with experience in CFD and machine learning (ML). The objective of this work is to accelerate CFD using the latest technological developments in ML and associated hardware. More specifically, the leading code for ML, Google’s TensorFlow™, will be linked to NETL’s MFiX and the solvers will be augmented/replaced with machine learned or hybrid algorithms which significantly accelerate computational speed without sacrificing accuracy. The primary challenge in this work is developing the ML algorithms that can be generalizable, accurate enough, and fast enough to be useful. This requires a substantial amount of data and the right model forms, as well as computing resources to train the models. The work also requires intimate knowledge of the workings of ML and data science. Having a strong background in the workings of CFD is not enough; therefore, we need individuals with ML and data science backgrounds. For analytical CFD, ML algorithms are not likely to be accurate enough on their own. Therefore, hybrid algorithms are likely to be key to development.\\nMajor Responsibilities\\nAssisting in developing ML models that solve systems ordinary differential equations/partial differential equations (ODE/PDEs) in less time to a given accuracy than the competitive iterative solvers.\\nImplementing TensorFlow™ based solvers to refine machine learned initial guesses as needed.\\nBenchmarking the new solvers on a variety of the latest hardware for ML models and compare to the traditional solution methods.\\nPresenting ideas and results to the research team.\\nContributing to future research planning and assisting with proposals.\\nWorking independently and collaboratively with members of the research team to meet milestones and deliverables.\\nAssisting or leading efforts in writing research papers and creating conference presentations.\\nPosition Requirements\\nTHE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:\\n\\nA B.S. or advanced degree in computer science, mathematics, or engineering, or a related field.\\nTwo or more years of prior relevant experience with CFD code development.\\nKnowledge of how the matrices and source terms in CFD are formed for finite volume methods.\\nTHE FOLLOWING IS DESIRED, BUT NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:\\n\\nExperience in and a strong knowledge of Python™.\\nMachine Learning (ML) in TensorFlow™ knowledge.\\nCFD experience using NETL’s MFiX software.\\nLegal Disclaimer\\nThe above statements are intended to describe the nature and level of work being performed by people assigned to this job. They are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all responsibilities, activities and skills required of staff members. No statement herein is intended to imply any authorities to commit Battelle unless special written permission is granted by Battelle’s Legal Department.\\nBENEFITS\\n\\nBattelle’s competitive benefits program includes comprehensive medical and dental care, matching 401K, paid time off, flexible spending accounts, disability coverage, and other benefits that help provide financial protection for you and your family.\\n\\nBattelle provides employment and opportunities for advancement, compensation, training, and growth according to individual merit, without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, age, genetic information, disability, veteran-status, or any other characteristic protected under applicable Federal, state, or local law.
