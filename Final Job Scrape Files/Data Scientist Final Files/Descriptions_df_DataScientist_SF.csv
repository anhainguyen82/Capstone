Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values
----------

We believe we can help build a future for everyone.


We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

We're pairing engineering with grant-making, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of our work is our partnership with Summit Learning -- a personalized approach to education developed by Summit Public Schools in partnership with learning scientists, researchers, and academics. With Summit Learning, students gain the skills, knowledge and habits to succeed in college and enter adulthood with a clear vision for achieving purpose and well-being in life.

Our Education Data Science team is responsible for measuring & evaluating product & program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding etc. The data science team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates & communicates with the cross-functional & leadership teams.

A unique opportunity to use your leadership skills, experience, and contacts to build a team and shape the culture of the company.
An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workers


Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody."

Triplebyte screens and evaluates thousands of engineers per month to find the best candidates for our partner companies. Human decision making doesn't work at our scale; our marketplace is powered by automated assessment and decision making. Triplebyte has three cornerstone ML products: our quiz, our interview, and our matchmaking. As a machine learning engineer, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end process of designing and running experiments to serving production models at scale. Some of our pipelines use off the shelf components, but we're also implementing custom models and techniques from the latest research papers. We're also building forecasting tools for internal teams to measure and predict outcomes. This is an ideal role for an engineer or data scientist who wants the scope and responsibility to own features/products from the inception and research phase through to measuring real-world results.

Our Mission
We believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We're building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper.

Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like ""gut feel"" or ""culture fit"". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That's the company we're building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. Starting with software engineers."

Atlassian is over a decade old, but the Marketing Analytics team is much younger. We blaze new trails to enable important growth decisions, so we're constantly growing, learning, and trying to do things differently.

We've been described as scrappy, but thorough, because we're dedicated to an agile methodology that enables moving fast while still ensuring quality deliverables. We also know all too well the importance of validating assumptions in our data, and we use various types of testing to prove those assumptions. It's all about enabling Atlassian to grow by delivering data in the right way to partners across the company.

Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.
It’s no secret the housing market has peaked. Lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to ride the down market and boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they’re used to in terms of speed and value.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.
Our streamlined, efficient algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company on January 7th. With a broader nationwide footprint, we are poised to transform this industry, repurposing the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our data science team
As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.
We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
2-10 years of relevant experience in data science
What's relevant? Any of the following:
Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them
Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools
Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Our definition of data science:
Data science is computerized math that makes inferences or predicts the future with enough accuracy to meet the key goals of an organization
Strengths aligned with our needs
Theoretical background relevant to data science
E.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?
Technical skills
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
Creative skills
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
Collaboration skills
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life
We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

123,Senior Data Scientist,"San Francisco, CA",San Francisco,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"At Afresh, we’re solving the big problems around food waste and the fresh food supply chain-focusing first in grocery. We use cutting-edge AI (we’ve been published in ICML!) combined with thoughtful design to enhance decision-making and optimize store workflows. The results are powerful: in live deployments in grocery stores, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+!
What will you be doing?
Performing analyses over billions of historical data points collected from across the food supply chain to find actionable patterns and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
Designing experiments for assessing the performance of machine learning algorithms. Proposing improvements to our core machine learning engine.
Deriving insights from customer data and communicating findings. Assessing the integrity of data and recommending solutions to integrity problems.
Overseeing the implementation of data pipelines within modern big data processing systems such as Spark and Hadoop.
Building visualization and data exploration tools that automate the analysis and debugging of machine learning models.
What skills do you need?
Masters or PhD in statistics, computer science, or equivalent.
4+ years of work experience.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

Proficiency with the Python data science stack, including numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib. Strong knowledge of SQL.
Experience with engineering machine learning systems is a big plus. Experience with modern big data systems such as Apache Spark or Hadoop is a big plus.
Background

About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.

Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.

Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the nuances of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in Fresh categories - produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit.

So far, the results are awesome! Like we said above, in live deployments, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+.

We're growing fast: we're in partnership with 4 large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality.
