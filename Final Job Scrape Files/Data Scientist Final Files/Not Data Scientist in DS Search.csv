COMPANY

LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE

We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").

Come work with us!
LendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status."

We invest our knowledge, talents and resources, helping our customers achieve their most important goals. We apply scientific rigor and creativity, succeeding where others may fail, and we invest in our communities, making the world better for generations to come. All of us share a common purpose: to solve the greatest challenges of today and tomorrow.

Our 22,000 employees work at the forefront of scientific innovation to tackle critical challenges in security, human health, manufacturing, energy and environmental management. Battelle’s work is grounded in the belief that science, technology and a passion for excellence can make industries more competitive and the world a better place.

We are currently seeking a Machine Learning Researcher. This position located in Pittsburgh, PA.

Primary Function
We are seeking a researcher with experience in CFD and machine learning (ML). The objective of this work is to accelerate CFD using the latest technological developments in ML and associated hardware. More specifically, the leading code for ML, Google’s TensorFlow™, will be linked to NETL’s MFiX and the solvers will be augmented/replaced with machine learned or hybrid algorithms which significantly accelerate computational speed without sacrificing accuracy. The primary challenge in this work is developing the ML algorithms that can be generalizable, accurate enough, and fast enough to be useful. This requires a substantial amount of data and the right model forms, as well as computing resources to train the models. The work also requires intimate knowledge of the workings of ML and data science. Having a strong background in the workings of CFD is not enough; therefore, we need individuals with ML and data science backgrounds. For analytical CFD, ML algorithms are not likely to be accurate enough on their own. Therefore, hybrid algorithms are likely to be key to development.
Major Responsibilities
Assisting in developing ML models that solve systems ordinary differential equations/partial differential equations (ODE/PDEs) in less time to a given accuracy than the competitive iterative solvers.
Implementing TensorFlow™ based solvers to refine machine learned initial guesses as needed.
Benchmarking the new solvers on a variety of the latest hardware for ML models and compare to the traditional solution methods.
Presenting ideas and results to the research team.
Contributing to future research planning and assisting with proposals.
Working independently and collaboratively with members of the research team to meet milestones and deliverables.
Assisting or leading efforts in writing research papers and creating conference presentations.
Position Requirements
THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:

A B.S. or advanced degree in computer science, mathematics, or engineering, or a related field.
Two or more years of prior relevant experience with CFD code development.
Knowledge of how the matrices and source terms in CFD are formed for finite volume methods.
THE FOLLOWING IS DESIRED, BUT NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:

Experience in and a strong knowledge of Python™.
Machine Learning (ML) in TensorFlow™ knowledge.
CFD experience using NETL’s MFiX software.

About Peritus
Peritus enables self-healing autonomous datacenters with automated, cognitive support for infrastructure software and hardware. It is a funded startup co-created at The Hive in Palo Alto, CA that delivers artificial intelligence-based virtual support expert systems for data center service fulfillment and incident resolution.

As datacenter vendors move from on-premise to the cloud their existing support system lacks the agility and cost-effectiveness for the cloud. Peritus significantly enhances operational efficiencies of existing support services and enables managed service providers & system vendors to offer new business continuity entitlements. Peritus assists & automates a wide spectrum of decisions in system support including incident classification, routing, contract coverage, incident resolution recipes and orchestration of incident management between subject matter experts (SMEs).

Peritus’ unique vectorization of system log data drives predictive modeling with highly granular feature extraction for early detection of system events. The platform’s advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities drive Peritus’ incident modeling and predictive capabilities. The core service fulfillment engine uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods to predict incident features from system log data. Peritus delivers automated orchestration of incident resolution through its close integration with existing incident management platforms.

Job Description
We are building a product that helps customers fulfill service requests as well as troubleshoot and diagnose infrastructure issues that cut across domains. The product needs to collect, collate and analyze logs, telemetry and monitoring data emanating from multi-vendor and multi-datacenter/cloud systems. The analysis should help with timestamp-based correlation of events across systems, extraction of inferences derived from performance counters from multiple systems and trace the sequence of events across layers of the data center stack.

Responsibilities
We are looking to hire an engineering technical leader with deep systems knowledge. The role entails a deeper understanding of how data center systems operate requiring familiarity with computing, storage, networking and virtualization products. Think DTrace but with a scope that spans across systems and not just within a system. The logs infrastructure needs to scale horizontally and enable machine learning models to learn systems behavior. Over time, the learning translates to automatic application of resolutions and thereby reducing human involvement.

Can you help fill in the blanks for users handling complex systems issues that affect performance and/or bring systems down?

Qualifications & Expertise
The successful engineer would have a proven track record of building complex log analysis platforms:

Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related fields

DEFI is part of FAST LabsTM, which acts as the research and development core of Electronic Systems’ five other business areas. Once we finish the research, we work to transition our programs to those business areas. Our tracking, fusion, and analytic algorithms go to the Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence, Surveillance, and Recognizance Systems (C4ISR) business area to improve their products that are used by military and intelligence analysts every day. Or they may go to the Electronic Combat Solutions (ECS) business area to add capability to their electronic warfare systems installed on aircraft like the F-35 or B-2.

Triplebyte helps companies find and hire great technical talent. For any company building software, this is crucial for success. A recent survey of top C-Level Executives, across multiple industries, showed that software, R&D and recruiting technical talent are the top areas they are planning increased investment and budget over the next 5 years. Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s online technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.

We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 40 will double in size during 2019. Now is a great time to join as we're on an exciting growth trajectory. You will have lots of opportunity for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.

We have built Machine Learning models that predict the likelihood of an engineer getting an offer from a particular company. Interviewing and assessing engineering talent tends to be noisy, but our technical assessment has proven to be good enough to extract meaningful signals. We collect data on interview results and in-house evaluations, which gives us a unique dataset to play with. We've used that data to deliver a 40% conversion rate on our candidates at interview to offer, compared to the industry standard 20%.

Our mission is to create a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently route it to the best place, streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process, while removing human biases that can hold back some candidates.

Our Mission
We believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We're building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper.

Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like ""gut feel"" or ""culture fit"". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That's the company we're building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. Starting with software engineers."

Job Description
The Complex Systems Simulation and Optimization Group in the NREL Computational Science Center has an opening for a full-time postdoctoral researcher in artificial intelligence (AI) and stochastic optimization for energy systems, with special emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (RL) for AI control. We believe that AI-powered systems have the potential to transform our renewable energy future through advanced automation and control, and are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background to help pursue this goal.
Stochastic optimization and sequential decision problems arise in a variety of areas of renewable energy research including power system planning and management, wind farm optimization, battery management, building energy management, and transportation. At the same time, recent advances in AI (and deep RL in particular) suggest that complex decision making can be optimized via a combination of machine learning, modeling and simulation, often with clear advantages over traditional optimization-based methods. However, these ideas are only just starting to be applied to renewable energy systems and thus constitute a promising set of research directions.
The successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, improve, and scale cutting edge AI methods to real-world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with NREL staff and researchers, other national labs, and universities on efforts to develop and apply AI at scale to real-world problems in renewable energy research, with specific emphasis on modernization of the nation’s grid, building, and transportation infrastructure and operation to support the 100% renewable energy scenario. In particular, the candidate will participate in a large interdisciplinary effort to establish the foundations of so-called “autonomous energy systems”, in which quasi-independent agents interact to seamlessly integrate and control large numbers of distributed energy resources.
Responsibilities include:
Collaborate with NREL and partner researchers to develop and apply modern AI and stochastic control techniques for use in real-world energy systems. Primary challenges include identification of appropriate application areas, adaptation of methods to these areas, and scaling of methods to solve relevant problems. Key areas of study include the optimal incorporation of existing domain knowledge into AI methods, the development of scalable algorithms for continuous and/or mixed spaces, and development of hybrid methods that combine the best of both AI and classical stochastic optimization.
Evaluate and track the state of artificial intelligence and stochastic control research, especially for sequential decision problems in complex real-world spaces.
Author, present and assist in the preparation of technical papers, reports and conference proceedings on topics related to modern AI control methods and their application to energy systems.
.
Basic Qualifications
Must be a recent PhD graduate within the last three years.

Additional Qualifications
Preferred Qualifications
Expertise in deep reinforcement learning, including fundamental knowledge and core mathematical underpinnings of neural networks, deep understanding of Markov Decision Processes, state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and their application to continuous and/or large state-action spaces.
Expertise in stochastic optimal control, including optimization and control with and without uncertainty, dynamic programming, classical control theory, (stochastic) model predictive control, Kalman filters, scenario generation, etc.
Experience with game theory, complex systems theory, agent-based learning, and distributed optimization.
Strong background in mathematics, statistics, and probability.
Strong background in physics and engineering, esp. of power systems, grid-integrated buildings, and/or transportation systems.
Strong programming skills, especially experience using deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow) on high-performance computing/GPU platforms.

Working closely with business stakeholders and senior leadership, you will help identify and solve complex language and currency problems and develop metrics and reports to measure our impact on our client’s business. In a typical day, you will work closely with the product management team, retail teams, machine-learning scientists, statisticians, software engineers, and various business groups.

About you:
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.

You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the our Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

About us together:
We're going to change the way that we think about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal candidate for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment, strong data mining and modeling skills and is comfortable facilitating ideation and working from concept through to execution. You will have demonstrated an ability to manage and develop medium to large-scale data tables, identify requirements and build financial reporting and planning models and tools that are statistically grounded but also explainable operationally, apply technical skills allowing the models to adapt to changing attributes, optimize forecast accuracy and to better understand and mitigate model variance drivers. In addition to building data tables, modeling and technical skills, you will possess strong written and verbal communication skills, strong focus on internal customers and professional demeanor and high intellectual curiosity with ability to learn new concepts and frameworks, algorithms and technology rapidly as changes arise.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of our global retail business) and employ Bigdata techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within our marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest Bigdata streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.

You look at problems holistically and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.

You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Our Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

About us together:
We're going to change the way that Our thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal candidate for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment, strong data mining and modeling skills and is comfortable facilitating ideation and working from concept through to execution. You will have demonstrated an ability to manage and develop medium to large-scale data tables, identify requirements and build financial reporting and planning models and tools that are statistically grounded but also explainable operationally, apply technical skills allowing the models to adapt to changing attributes, optimize forecast accuracy and to better understand and mitigate model variance drivers. In addition to building data tables, modeling and technical skills, you will possess strong written and verbal communication skills, strong focus on internal customers and professional demeanor and high intellectual curiosity with ability to learn new concepts and frameworks, algorithms and technology rapidly as changes arise.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of our global retail business) and employ Bigdata techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within the Our marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest Bigdata streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

Questions?
You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.

Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun.
Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today.
Our team is building the Map Perception component of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK, with the goal to build a scalable crowd-sourced mapping platform for autonomous driving, that will enable a fleet of autonomous vehicles to create and consume map data collaboratively.

Good communications and analytical skills. Ability to work with multiple multi-functional teams across multiple time zones.
Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd:
Experience developing real-time LIDAR Perception and/or Computer Vision systems and / or scalable cloud based mapping solutions.
Experience fusing data from different sensor modalities (e.g. Images and LIDAR data) to enable information conflation, label propagation, cross training for deep learning.
Experience with visual geometry and deep learning in a shipping product context.
Software development on embedded platforms or large scale cloud services.
Experience with GPGPU programming (CUDA and OpenCL).
We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents are responsible for ~1.25 million deaths per year world-wide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team.
NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
