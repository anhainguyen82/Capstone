COMPANY

LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE

We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").

We’ve built a proprietary technology platform that delivers experiences at each step of a consumer’s journey and collects a rich stream of data to learn what treatments increase the likelihood of a valuable outcome for our clients. We use distributed systems to solve complex compute problems, develop data architectures to support analysis and uncover insights, and use those insights to deliver optimal consumer experiences at scale. Our platform is a high-volume processing system supporting some of the largest companies in the US in ways their internal teams, agencies and IT consultants simply cannot.

iProspect is a great place to work. We have competitive pay, a matching 401k package, life & disability insurance as well as bonus potential.

State in Chicago’s River North at the end of May. The Grand and State Red Line stop is right outside the front door and there are lots of great lunch spots within walking distance.
The real perk of this job is the ability to contribute to a profitable and growing company that strives to give employees the ability to master their craft, increase their skills and be autonomous in their work. We are a small enough division that you can witness and be rewarded for your contributions but are part of large network that allows us to partner with Fortune 100 companies.

To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently.

Preferred Qualifications

Oracle Database Security Development Group is the core security group in Oracle. The team developed a variety of core security products in Oracle Database Kernel.

Oracle Databases hold the majority of the world’s relational data, and are attractive targets for attackers seeking high-value targets for data theft. Compromise of a single Oracle Database can result in tens of millions of breached records costing millions in breach-mitigation activity. Safeguard your most valuable data with Oracle’s powerful preventive and detective security controls, including transparent data encryption, encryption key management, privileged user and multi-factor access control, data classification and discovery, database activity monitoring and blocking, consolidated auditing and reporting, and data masking. With Oracle, you can deploy reliable data-security solutions that require no changes to existing applications, saving time and money.


Oracle Advanced Security provides two important preventive controls to protect sensitive data at the source: encryption and redaction. Together, these two controls form the foundation of Oracle's defense-in-depth, multi-layered database security solution.


Transparent Data Ecryption (TDE) stops would-be attackers from bypassing the database and reading sensitive information directly from storage by enforcing data-at-rest encryption in the database layer.


Data Redaction complements TDE by reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure in applications, redacting sensitive data before it leaves the database.
Authenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security. Passwords are the most common means of authentication. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including SSL with digital certificates.
Oracle Advanced Security team works on all layers of the database kernel stack and provide advanced security products for customers.

Job Description
You will be a key contributor in designing and implementing major pieces of the core database infrastructure for security.
You will design major core data-security products that work with replication, data high availability, and disaster recovery, Implement database techniques and features to support service scalability, performance and stability.

Amazon is breaking new ground and changing the rules for relational databases. The PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is helping customers have enterprise performance, availability and durability, along with compatibility with the world's most advanced open source database - PostgreSQL. If you’re an engineer who is looking to grow, come on board! We have one of the most senior teams in AWS - and our senior engineers are eager to brainstorm, mentor, and get software built together. We built software, we patent new things, and we attend conferences around the world to learn even more.

Amazon Aurora is an exciting new area of innovation for AWS, and the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is the newest part of it, built on one of the cleanest code bases in the open source community. The PostgreSQL-compatible version of Amazon Aurora is a new relational database which offers enterprise-class performance, availability and durability - all at open source prices - to our customers, along with the management benefits of RDS. We’re a relatively new team in Database Services, one of the fastest growing businesses within Amazon Web Services. We are currently spread across Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Sydney, and Dublin. Not only do we have deep database and systems programming problems to solve for our customers, but we also minimize the effort required to maintain SQL databases by automating administrative tasks like backup / restore, scaling CPU / RAM / storage and replication / failover for high availability, allowing our customers to spend their valuable time focused on building their businesses.

RDS for PostgreSQL runs the largest fleet of PostgreSQL databases in the world. We make regular software releases, take care of our customers, and take care of our engineers. PostgreSQL is the most advanced open source database out there, and we’re proud to contribute to its success. By combining the open source power and popularity of PostgreSQL with Amazon Web Services, for both our database engines, we think we have a winning combination for both startups and enterprises who are moving all their most important data and applications to the cloud. Check out the awesomeness of PostgreSQL at https://www.postgresql.org/.

We have challenging problems to solve in distributed systems, concurrency, database internals, caching, query optimization, languages, and performance engineering. We intend to be the world's best and fastest database, built by an excellent team, all while having fun - come join us on the journey!

The Role
This position is on an exciting new team building a highly available, very scalable, high performance database offering. We have the need for low-level systems C programmers, mid-tier high performance C++ developers, and distributed systems Java wizards.

About You
You’ve built a lot of software – shipped products, created platforms, tools and modules, perhaps worked with every framework under the sun, perhaps made everything you have touched fast as lightning. You may have built big, distributed, API-driven systems with thousands of users, or systems for billions of transactions. You’re as excited as we are about learning every day, and solving really hard engineering problems that no one else is.

Passionate about software quality, repeatability, testability and maintainability, you are known to your co-workers as the go-to person for answers to questions that begin with the phrase “what’s the best way to…” – even though your answers tend to start with “help me understand what you’re trying to accomplish by…”. When you need clarity, you go to the product owner – or even a user – and talk to them until you get it. With stakeholders and other team members you are diplomatic, persuasive, and usually right. You understand the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in production, and your designs and implementations reflect that understanding.

When you’re wrong, you’re happy to learn something. You build software quickly, but properly (so that you don’t have to go back to it later). You know what “unit tests” are and don’t implement software without them. Shipping on time with high quality makes your heart feel warm.

Who are you? You’re the new Software Development Engineer joining us at RDS. We work hard, have fun and make history – want to come play with us?

What You’ll Do
Design and implement features for new and existing products, features, APIs, platforms and frameworksLead architecture / design conversations and code reviews (yours and other team members’)Work with managers and team members to estimate effort and clarify / negotiate / document scope and designContribute to design, architecture, process and development standardsEffectively mentor more junior team members, helping to maintain appropriate unit test coverage, code documentation, software structure and supportabilityArgue for the right outcomes with data, conviction and diplomacyIdentify, evaluate and suggest mitigation strategies for risks during design

What do we look for?
--------------------

We are looking for a well-rounded front-line DBA to protect, maintain and manage changes to our core 24x7 OLTP production server. Deep knowledge of availability groups and performance tuning is essential as is demonstrable experience in dealing with an incident. We expect you to take ownership of our environment and together with the rest of the data team handle any incidents that are escalated.

----------------------
What can we offer you?
----------------------

We are fast adopters of new SQL tech as we often find there are problems waiting to be fixed e.g. temporal tables, clustered column stores, In-memory tech, auto plan correction, distributed availability groups, managed backups, clusterless AG's etc. We are on SQL2017 right now, and you can be sure we will be on SQL2019 when it comes.

-----------------------
Example Recent Projects
-----------------------

We are a small team so a dislike for firefighting or spinning plates and a love for building automation and brains into our system is desired. Here are examples of proven projects that have successfully added to our stability and scalability. Some of them were open source, and some are internal projects we have open sourced on GitHub.


Managing scheduling of SQLAgent jobs gracefully in the face of failovers with an availability group – we built and open-sourced tsqlScheduler ( https://github.com/taddison/tsqlScheduler ) to handle that. As an added bonus it also allows us to source-control our jobs and deploy them to dev/qa/production.
We took the shock absorber ( https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2013/09/19/in-memory-oltp-common-design-pattern-high-data-input-rateshock-absorber/ ) idea and implemented it, providing us with a massive throughput boost for data ingestion
Automated infrastructure testing with PowerShell, open-sourced as the SQLChecks ( https://github.com/taddison/SQLChecks/pull/21 ) library.
Auto rogue session management system ( https://github.com/taddison/ED209 ). Built to police the report infrastructure. Power users often perform custom analysis over the large, raw datasets. But sometimes their queries can take the server to its knees. Our system identifies these queries and warns the user. The user can then choose to proceed with their query, or the system can terminate the query.
Rotating log Ring Buffers ( http://kejser.org/table-pattern-rotating-log-ring-buffer/ ), a low maintenance way to keep the size of our logging tables under control
Powershell functions ( https://github.com/petervandivier/SqlCodeReview ) for developers to send SQL code review requests to the database team. The powershell functions will take a dev and production copy of the SQL objects, pull them into GIT and send a PR to the database team comparing the two.
Auto data archiving to Azure using data factory. In trying to find that perfect trade-off between cost and performance, we keep data onsite for as long as possible and then it is automatically archived using a rolling window.

------------------------
What would your role be?
------------------------

In addition to planning and executing on larger projects designed to push some or all of the entire team forwards, you'll also be responsible for the following kinds of work:


Reviewing SQL pull requests - both we and the development team see PRs as an excellent learning opportunity, and we'll expect you to help educate and work with the wider team to deliver the 'best' (most appropriate) solution
Triaging and reacting to alerts - whether automating them away or reviewing the true exceptions that bubble up, you need to keep our servers running with a clean bill of health
Performance tuning specific SQL or applications - sometimes the perfect v1 design doesn't scale to v2 data volumes, and we have to roll up our sleeves and optimize appropriately (wall clock, CPU, memory...)
Review our baselines and plan any work required - whether space, performance & scalability (CPU/IO), or security - our business doesn't stand still, so neither will any of our baselines. Your job is to figure out when and what action needs taking.
