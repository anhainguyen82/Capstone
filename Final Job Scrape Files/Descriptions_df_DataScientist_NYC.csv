We're one of the fastest growing homeownership companies in America. Why? Because we're building a better way to get home and our customers love it. By combining smarter technology with an award-winning team of mortgage experts, we're making homeownership so simple it feels magical.

So far, we've:

Helped more than 10,000 families get home
Financed over $3B in loans
Saved families an average of $32,000 in fees over the life of their loans
Grew our geographic coverage to 36 states, up from 15 states from a year ago

And we're not slowing down. We continue to outpace the rest of the industry at every turn.

Our backers have helped build some of the most transformative tech and finance companies in history. Kleiner Perkins, Goldman Sachs, IA Ventures, Ally Bank, American Express, and others have invested over $150MM in Better and our vision of making homeownership magical.

A Better opportunity:
Help us hack a thirteen trillion dollar industry by building a product that will allow more people than the status quo to own a home and build wealth rather than rent for life. Our tech team is small, and you will be a big part of defining the technical direction and culture. We encourage proposals for projects off the beaten path, experimentation with different frameworks and libraries, and doing as you see fit to solve problems. We also offer above-market compensation and equity, as well as full benefits.

Some projects you could be working on:

Work closely with our product team to understand funnel drop off and come up with product ideas
Work closely with the marketing team to optimize our acquisition funnel
Present conclusions to the executive team that can impact the strategic direction of the company
Build a lead scoring model to help our customer support team prioritize.
Model the time-lag of conversions ( https://github.com/better/convoys ) using fun math like Gamma distributions
Design an experiment to understand the causal impact of an outbound phone call on conversion rates
Build web scrapers to track price data for other mortgage lenders
Migrate our data warehouse to Redshift
Work on our underwriting engine, which turns out to be NP-complete and can be posed as a mixed integer programming problem
Transcribe all our phone calls using speech-to-text and figure out ways to optimize customer support.

Better Technology:

We do continuous deployment and we ship code 50-100 times every day
The data stack is all in Python 3.6
We use Node.js, Python and Scala for services
Postgres for the database
Kubernetes, for deployment and devops
AWS for infrastructure, leveraging EC2, S3, SWF, CloudFront, Route53, and much more

The team:

The tech team is currently 30 engineers but growing quickly
Erik Bernhardsson ( https://twitter.com/fulhack ) (CTO) used to run the data team and the music recommendation team at Spotify. He is the open source author of a few popular projects like Annoy ( https://github.com/spotify/annoy ) and Luigi ( https://github.com/spotify/luigi ) and writes a blog ( http://erikbern.com/ ) about (mostly) data

Things we value:

Curiosity. Why? How? Repeat.
Nerdiness. Financial news and trends are fascinating. Seriously.
Relentlessness. No one here gives up. We try. We fail. We try again.
Passion. If you don't get excited about homeownership, mortgages, and real estate, it simply won't work.
Smarts: book and street. We have to use all the tools at our disposal to build Better.
Empathy and Compassion. You understand that people's biggest dreams are in your hands.
Communication. Can you ask for help or put your hand up when you don't understand?
Building. Doing. Making. Yes, we have to do a lot of thinking and talking to figure this stuff out, but you can't wait to leave the conversation and build it

History of Slice:
Slice was born in 2010 and has quietly bootstrapped its way to building a network of more than 11,000 pizzerias nationwide. Ilir Sela ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2018/04/10/pizza-unchained-tech-startup-slice-helps-local-pizzerias-get-online-and-fight-back-against-dominos/#56b483651263 ), our founder and CEO, started the company as a passion project to help his friends and family in the pizza business, but he quickly saw a massive opportunity to champion these small businesses by bringing their craft to the masses. Ilir has since built an amazing team of operators, marketers, technologists, and investors — all dedicated to making it easier for people to enjoy their favorite local pizza while helping local shops succeed.

Our Pizza Philosophy

Slice is on a journey to be the most valuable pizza brand on the planet. We connect makers and eaters to enrich their lives through the power of specialization and pizza expertise. Backed by generations of knowledge and cutting-edge technology, we give makers the platform and voice to take charge of their industry, expand their coverage, and fill the world with authentic cuisine. When passionate makers turn their craft into their livelihood, we all live happier, fuller lives. People stop accepting the homogenous, mass-produced pies of big chains and robotic trucks because the quality, variety, and authenticity of Slice is both hyper-convenient and known worldwide. We believe pizza isn't just food. It's a slice of community, a slice of culture, a slice of life.

We're growing our family every day — so, if you've got a passion for local, authentic pizza and the drive to help share it with the world, we'd love to have you on the team!

organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door
The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

We place particular emphasis on providing a robust system of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.

On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
Specifically, we are looking for:

A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.
Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming


What it’s like to work here:

On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.
We’re 70ish genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.
We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.
We’re building a company and a team we love. We’re in it for the long run.

As one of the most exciting and unique candidates in the Democratic presidential race, entrepreneur Andrew Yang sets out to bridge the divide in American society. In 2011, he founded Venture for America, an entrepreneurial non-profit that helped create 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh.

Once Andrew realized that new technology, such as artificial intelligence, threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs, he knew he had to do something. In The War on Normal People (2018), he explains the mounting crisis and makes the case for implementing a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult: no strings attached. Most importantly, Andrew Yang understands that the future of America is not left, not right, but forward.

You can also hear more from Andrew on the Joe Rogan Experience!

Every campaign claims to be data driven. After working for us, you'll realize everyone else is just fooling themselves.

The data team needs top tier analytic talent to answer the big questions of the campaign. The campaign turns to us when they want to know where to buy ads, where to direct field efforts, where to host big events, how to raise money, or where we're getting enough delegates to win.

Experience doing reporting and data visualization
Analysis and model building skills
Insight into what the data can show us, strategically and politically
Deep alignment with the Yang2020 platform

About us:
Warby Parker was founded with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in-house, we're able to offer top-quality glasses and sunglasses (plus an uncommonly delightful shopping experience) at a fraction of the traditional going price.

Since starting out in 2010, we've set up headquarters in New York City and Nashville, built our own optical lab, and opened retail locations all around the U.S. and Canada. As we grow, we're committed to proving that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world. For every pair of glasses we sell, a pair is distributed to someone in need—to date, that's over five million pairs.

Of course, all work and no play makes a dull workplace. Who likes that? At Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, volunteering and learning opportunities, and just great company. Teammates can also connect around common interests, backgrounds, and identities, no matter their home base, through our various employee resource groups. (We're happy to say that the Human Rights Campaign has named us a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ employees!) That sense of community keeps us excited to walk through the door every day. Good work, good people.

Simon Data was founded in 2015 by a team of successful serial entrepreneurs. We're a data-first marketing platform startup, and we approach our work seriously; we tackle problems in a scrappy and disruptive fashion, yet we build for scale to support our clients at big data volume.

We are the first and only enterprise customer data platform with a fully-integrated marketing cloud. Moving beyond the limitations of both categories, Simon's platform empowers businesses to leverage enterprise-scale big data and machine learning to power customer communications in any channel. Simon's unique approach allows brands to develop incredible personalization capabilities without needing to build and maintain massive bespoke data infrastructure.

Our culture is rooted in organizational transparency, empowering individuals, and an attitude of getting things done. If you want to be a valuable contributor on a team that cultivates these core values we would love to hear from you.

THE ROLE

As a Data Scientist at Simon, you will be working as part of a collaborative/user focused team and be responsible for designing and building smart systems that drive revenue—our statistical models are at the core of our product, and will only become more so as we continue to develop and add features. We take an approach to ML that is data-first, and requires principled modeling decisions: we don't believe in theory-crafting models before we have collected the data that will power them, as well as built out the business process that will continue to generate that data. In the model building process, we prioritize interpretable models whose training and performance yield insights about the underlying process, along with optimizing the selected objective.

Our technologies of choice are Python in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend, and our tech stack includes Django, MySQL, Redshift, S3, DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch storage, asynchronous tasks over RabbitMQ, and distributed data processing over Elastic MapReduce and Spark.

WHAT YOU'LL DO


Build ML products that leverage Simon's extraordinary data access to drive real business value
Build high-quality statistical models by executing the entire model-building process, including data cleaning, feature extraction, model selection, and predictive validation
Contribute to the tooling and interfaces used to support the data science process at Simon
Represent Simon DS in conversations with stakeholders at our client companies
Advance Simon as a thought leader in data science, by writing blog posts and papers, and presenting at industry conferences
Guide internal product and technology strategy by representing data science perspectives and requirements in conversations with your peers

QUALIFICATIONS


Ph.D. in Statistics/Machine Learning, or equivalent
