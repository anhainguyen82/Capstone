We are looking for a high performing data scientist for our Quickbooks Capital business. QuickBooks Capital is a nimble and high-priority start-up within Intuit that is looking to reinvent small business borrowing and we are the team responsible for using our data to answer the most critical questions facing the Capital Product Managers. We are growing rapidly and need great people to generate analytical insights to understand our product and customers.

What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.

You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.

In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.

We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

We are currently accepting applications for a Data Scientist. We encourage all qualified applicants, including people of color, gays and lesbians, women, transgender people, veterans, and people with disabilities. We particularly encourage people who are underrepresented in politics and startups to apply. We prioritize equity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity of perspectives and experiences makes our work better.

About the Role:
As a Data Scientist, you’ll be involved in all aspects of our analytics, research, model development, and data pipeline. We’re a small but growing company and each team member contributes in a meaningful way. We interview millions of voters through our platform - a novel dataset with tremendous utility for political campaigns. On any given day, you might be building a model to find swing voters, or cleaning data for our political team’s analysis, or optimizing the way we find survey respondents.

In your first weeks:
Expected skills: best-in-class facility with Python (preferably) and/or R (acceptable) as well as SQL; team-based experience with Github; aptitude for working with datasets up to 1TB; experience building predictive models and applying statistics to industrial problems
Example project: build a data pipeline to make available to our political team’s analysis

By the end of the year, as campaigns are just gearing up for 2020:
Expected skills: complete familiarity with our codebase and tech stack, so that you can commit production-ready code
Example project: building a model to find voters sympathetic to gun-control legislation
What you’ll learn: how campaigns use (or don’t yet use) data; an intimate knowledge of our amassed polling data, including political attitudes across the country
In 2020 and Beyond:
Expected skills: solve novel problems, and formulate your own product ideas that anticipate problems before they come up. Write code that rivals that of a senior engineer, and introduce new modeling techniques to the team.
Example project: design an Auto ML process for predicting novel variables
What you’ll learn: How to be part of a growing data science team, contributing both ideas and technical prowess. Become an integral part of our data science operation and help the company grow its impact in Democratic politics
A successful member of our team will demonstrate the curiosity to try new things, but the self-discipline to prize results over technique. We’re open to hiring for a range of levels. The specific job will be commensurate with a candidate’s work experience and potential. Political experience is not required, but if you don’t have a passion for it you might burn out.

Compensation and work environment:
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Our workplace is both casual and professional, and we are committed to learning, fun, and excellence. We are an equal opportunity employer. This full-time position includes equity, health, dental and vision insurance, commuter benefits, flexible PTO, and company holidays.

Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways.

We are looking for strong Data Scientists to join our AI Data Science and Analytics team in Menlo Park, to focus on AI Models Measurement. The team’s mission is to understand and measure the impact of our AI systems for any product use-case. Currently, most innovations in our AI technologies (Vision, Speech, Language) are measured against external datasets. While useful for understanding our performance relative to external systems, these external benchmarks are problematic because they may not represent performance on Facebook specific use-cases (because of differences in data content, deployment, pre-processing, etc.). Furthermore, for our biggest AI platforms around Video, Speech and Language understanding we typically measure impact of major changes only at the model level and not at the product level. This means that while our technologies may generally advance, it's not well-understood what specific improvements these changes drive for Facebook, except for on an ad hoc basis. The team is building an internal benchmarking platform that provides Facebook specific data, models and metrics for AI researchers, engineers and product managers to guide their decisions.

You will be responsible to help define the methodologies and metrics relevant in building an AI Model Measurement platform.

You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.

In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.

We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

We are currently accepting applications for a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing. We encourage all qualified applicants, including people of color, gays and lesbians, women, transgender people, veterans, and people with disabilities. We particularly encourage people who are underrepresented in politics and startups to apply. We prioritize equity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity of perspectives and experiences makes our work better.

About the Role:
As a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing, you’ll be involved in all aspects of our analytics, research, model development, and data pipeline. We’re a small but growing company and each team member contributes in a meaningful way. We interview millions of voters through our platform - a novel dataset with tremendous utility for political campaigns. Your role will be focused on turning unstructured public opinion into empirical conclusions.

In your first weeks:
Expected skills: best-in-class facility with Python (preferably) and/or R (acceptable) as well as SQL; team-based experience with Github; experience applying Natural Language Processing models in an industrial setting.
Example project: classifying topics within a sample of open-ended survey responses
What you’ll learn: the technology we’ve developed to help campaigns win
By the end of the year, as campaigns are just gearing up for 2020:
Expected skills: complete familiarity with our codebase and tech stack, so that you can commit production-ready code
Example project: create automatic features from open-ended text to be used in other models
What you’ll learn: how campaigns use (or don’t yet use) data; an intimate knowledge of our amassed polling data, including political attitudes across the country
In 2020 and Beyond:
Expected skills: solve novel problems, and formulate your own product ideas that anticipate problems before they come up. Write code that rivals that of a senior engineer, and introduce new modeling techniques to the team.
Example project: design an ensemble of models that can process a broad range of answers to open-ended questions like “What do you think of your Congresswoman?” or “What is the biggest issue unaddressed by your local government”?
What you’ll learn: How to be part of a growing data science team, contributing both ideas and technical prowess. Become an integral part of our data science operation and help the company grow its impact in Democratic politics
A successful member of our team will demonstrate the curiosity to try new things, but the self-discipline to prize results over technique. We’re open to hiring for a range of levels. The specific job will be commensurate with a candidate’s work experience and potential. Political experience is not required, but if you don’t have a passion for it you might burn out.

Compensation and work environment:
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Our workplace is both casual and professional, and we are committed to learning, fun, and excellence. We are an equal opportunity employer. This full-time position includes equity, health, dental and vision insurance, commuter benefits, flexible PTO, and company holidays.
