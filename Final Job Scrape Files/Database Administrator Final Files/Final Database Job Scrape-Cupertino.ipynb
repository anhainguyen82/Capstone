If you’re an engineer who is looking to grow, come on board! We have one of the most senior teams in AWS - and our senior engineers are eager to brainstorm, mentor, and get software built together. We built software, we patent new things, and we attend conferences around the world to learn even more.\\n\\nAmazon Aurora is an exciting new area of innovation for AWS, and the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is the newest part of it, built on one of the cleanest code bases in the open source community. The PostgreSQL-compatible version of Amazon Aurora is a new relational database which offers enterprise-class performance, availability and durability - all at open source prices - to our customers, along with the management benefits of RDS. We’re a relatively new team in Database Services, one of the fastest growing businesses within Amazon Web Services. We are currently spread across Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Sydney, and Dublin. Not only do we have deep database and systems programming problems to solve for our customers, but we also minimize the effort required to maintain SQL databases by automating administrative tasks like backup / restore, scaling CPU / RAM / storage and replication / failover for high availability, allowing our customers to spend their valuable time focused on building their businesses.\\n\\nRDS for PostgreSQL runs the largest fleet of PostgreSQL databases in the world. We make regular software releases, take care of our customers, and take care of our engineers. PostgreSQL is the most advanced open source database out there, and we’re proud to contribute to its success.
