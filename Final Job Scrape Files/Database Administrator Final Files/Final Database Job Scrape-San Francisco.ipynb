Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.\\nFor organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.\\nTo do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.\\nRole Responsibilities\\nPlans database upgrades by maintaining , evaluating, and\\nimproving a transaction processing model\\nAssesses database performance by developing a protocol for\\nmeasurement of results and identification of problem areas.\\nSupports database performance by monitoring database\\nperformance; evaluating and resolving processing and\\nprogramming problems; designing database management tools;\\nanswering user questions.\\nSecures database by preparing access and control policies and\\nprocedures; implementing disaster recovery procedures.\\nSupports application design by contributing expertise to\\napplications, operations, and technical support teams.\\nUpdates job knowledge by participating in educational\\nopportunities; reading professional publications; maintaining\\npersonal networks; participating in professional organizations.\\nAccomplishes information systems and organization mission by\\ncompleting related results as needed.\\nAssists in the QA review of data being entered into the\\ndatabase.\\nAssists in the implementation of any newly developed or\\nupgraded component within TIER.\\nRequirements\\nExperience in MySql\\nKnowledge of Transact SQL and SQL performance, monitoring\\nand tuning\\nAdvanced computer skills and proficiency in Microsoft Office,\\nInternet and Intranet; database use and maintenance\\nSQL knowledge preferred</td>\n",

The team developed a variety of core security products in Oracle Database Kernel.\\n\\nOracle Databases hold the majority of the world’s relational data, and are attractive targets for attackers seeking high-value targets for data theft. Compromise of a single Oracle Database can result in tens of millions of breached records costing millions in breach-mitigation activity. Safeguard your most valuable data with Oracle’s powerful preventive and detective security controls, including transparent data encryption, encryption key management, privileged user and multi-factor access control, data classification and discovery, database activity monitoring and blocking, consolidated auditing and reporting, and data masking. With Oracle, you can deploy reliable data-security solutions that require no changes to existing applications, saving time and money.\\n\\n\\nOracle Advanced Security provides two important preventive controls to protect sensitive data at the source: encryption and redaction. Together, these two controls form the foundation of Oracle's defense-in-depth, multi-layered database security solution.\\n\\n\\nTransparent Data Ecryption (TDE) stops would-be attackers from bypassing the database and reading sensitive information directly from storage by enforcing data-at-rest encryption in the database layer.\\n\\n\\nData Redaction complements TDE by reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure in applications, redacting sensitive data before it leaves the database.\\nAuthenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security.

       "0   Who we are\\nZinier is a global company headquartered in San Mateo, California, with offices in Mexico City, Singapore, and Bengaluru and backed by leading investors including Accel Partners and Founders Fund.\\nWhy we exist\\nServices shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.\\nFor organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.\\nTo do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.\\nRole Responsibilities\\nPlans database upgrades by maintaining , evaluating, and\\nimproving a transaction processing model\\nAssesses database
