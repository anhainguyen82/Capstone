Always be kind: a simple daily affirmation and one that feels more like a personal mission statement than a corporate motto -- but Pivotal isn't just any corporation. Underpinning our world-class capabilities in cloud-native software delivery and agile development methodologies is one common thread: empathy. Not only do we want to transform the way the world builds software, we also want to make sure that sustainable pace, kindness, and diversity are at the core of every enterprise.

Known for taking an iterative approach, our 3000+ employees are empowered every day to help shape the way we build software. Pivotal is committed to open source, a diverse culture ( https://content.pivotal.io/blog/diversity-and-inclusion-in-everyday-work ), and fostering safe spaces for all of our individual employees.

We are looking for engineers who want to make a lasting impact on our enterprise-grade database offerings, Pivotal Greenplum, Pivotal Postgres, and MySQL for PCF.

You
---

You are looking for a collaborative environment building database systems that enable enterprises to focus on their business rather than architecting open source database solutions from scratch.

You are a polyglot who loves learning new programming languages and systems. Furthering your education has always been a goal of yours. Pair programming is either something you enjoy or something that you wanted to try out.

You believe in relentless automation to simplify operating inherently complex things.

Contributing to open-source software makes you feel good about the transparency it brings to an organization's code quality.

Us
--

Agile concepts are at the core of our process. We have a whole host of Pivotal Practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives, and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation.

We believe in a sustainable pace, so we work 8 hour days, maintaining core hours to support collaboration. Although on-call rotations are part of most teams, incidents are exceedingly rare.

We pair in small teams of 4 - 8 people in our San Francisco and Palo Alto offices. We prefer to be co-located but when we do work with team members in other locations we use Slack ( https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/ ) to stay connected and screen sharing for pairing. We work hard to ensure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems.

Making an investment in each Pivot's professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage you to go to conferences, take classes, and read books -- and we'll give you a budget each year to do it.
