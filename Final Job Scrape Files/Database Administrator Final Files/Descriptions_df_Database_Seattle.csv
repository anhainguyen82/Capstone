Amazon is breaking new ground and changing the rules for relational databases. The PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is helping customers have enterprise performance, availability and durability, along with compatibility with the world's most advanced open source database - PostgreSQL. If you’re an engineer who is looking to grow, come on board! We have one of the most senior teams in AWS - and our senior engineers are eager to brainstorm, mentor, and get software built together. We built software, we patent new things, and we attend conferences around the world to learn even more.

Amazon Aurora is an exciting new area of innovation for AWS, and the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is the newest part of it, built on one of the cleanest code bases in the open source community. The PostgreSQL-compatible version of Amazon Aurora is a new relational database which offers enterprise-class performance, availability and durability - all at open source prices - to our customers, along with the management benefits of RDS. We’re a relatively new team in Database Services, one of the fastest growing businesses within Amazon Web Services. We are currently spread across Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Sydney, and Dublin. Not only do we have deep database and systems programming problems to solve for our customers, but we also minimize the effort required to maintain SQL databases by automating administrative tasks like backup / restore, scaling CPU / RAM / storage and replication / failover for high availability, allowing our customers to spend their valuable time focused on building their businesses.

RDS for PostgreSQL runs the largest fleet of PostgreSQL databases in the world. We make regular software releases, take care of our customers, and take care of our engineers. PostgreSQL is the most advanced open source database out there, and we’re proud to contribute to its success. By combining the open source power and popularity of PostgreSQL with Amazon Web Services, for both our database engines, we think we have a winning combination for both startups and enterprises who are moving all their most important data and applications to the cloud. Check out the awesomeness of PostgreSQL at https://www.postgresql.org/.

We have challenging problems to solve in distributed systems, concurrency, database internals, caching, query optimization, languages, and performance engineering. We intend to be the world's best and fastest database, built by an excellent team, all while having fun - come join us on the journey!

The Role
This position is on an exciting new team building a highly available, very scalable, high performance database offering. We have the need for low-level systems C programmers, mid-tier high performance C++ developers, and distributed systems Java wizards.

About You
You’ve built a lot of software – shipped products, created platforms, tools and modules, perhaps worked with every framework under the sun, perhaps made everything you have touched fast as lightning. You may have built big, distributed, API-driven systems with thousands of users, or systems for billions of transactions. You’re as excited as we are about learning every day, and solving really hard engineering problems that no one else is.

Passionate about software quality, repeatability, testability and maintainability, you are known to your co-workers as the go-to person for answers to questions that begin with the phrase “what’s the best way to…” – even though your answers tend to start with “help me understand what you’re trying to accomplish by…”. When you need clarity, you go to the product owner – or even a user – and talk to them until you get it. With stakeholders and other team members you are diplomatic, persuasive, and usually right. You understand the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in production, and your designs and implementations reflect that understanding.

When you’re wrong, you’re happy to learn something. You build software quickly, but properly (so that you don’t have to go back to it later). You know what “unit tests” are and don’t implement software without them. Shipping on time with high quality makes your heart feel warm.

Who are you? You’re the new Software Development Engineer joining us at RDS. We work hard, have fun and make history – want to come play with us?

What You’ll Do
Design and implement features for new and existing products, features, APIs, platforms and frameworksLead architecture / design conversations and code reviews (yours and other team members’)Work with managers and team members to estimate effort and clarify / negotiate / document scope and designContribute to design, architecture, process and development standardsEffectively mentor more junior team members, helping to maintain appropriate unit test coverage, code documentation, software structure and supportabilityArgue for the right outcomes with data, conviction and diplomacyIdentify, evaluate and suggest mitigation strategies for risks during design

Desirable experience (i.e. “Stuff that will impress us”):
Linux / UNIX system experienceDeveloping in extremely busy, highly scalable, highly available mission-critical distributed environmentsDeep experience with SQL / NoSQL databasesExtensive software / database architectureHands-on experience with AWS APIs and services

COMPANY

LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE

We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").

Come work with us!
LendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status."

Your Opportunity
Do you want to work on databases that process hundreds of billions of transactions per month? Do you aspire to design database systems that are highly reliable, performant and easy to operate using the automation you build? If you find these challenges exciting, we encourage you to apply.
We’re looking for a Lead Database Engineer to join our growing team. You’ll be responsible for deploying and administering MySQL, Postgres, and Redis systems used by New Relic teams. You’ll get to design automated, flexible systems capable of scaling to meet the growing demand of our fully containerized database platform. You’ll also learn about the data requirements of New Relic products by partnering with internal teams to provide guidance on data store selection, schema design, and query optimization.
As a part of the Database team, you’ll be working with engineers who build and support our database orchestration platform in a fast-paced environment where things change rapidly, and where we’re constantly increasing our scale. We believe in using automation to increase reliability and reduce toil, so you’ll have the opportunity to use your programming skills to automate the administration of our database systems.

What You’ll Do
