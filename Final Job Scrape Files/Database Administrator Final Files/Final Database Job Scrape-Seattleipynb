The PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is helping customers have enterprise performance, availability and durability, along with compatibility with the world's most advanced open source database - PostgreSQL. If you’re an engineer who is looking to grow, come on board! We have one of the most senior teams in AWS - and our senior engineers are eager to brainstorm, mentor, and get software built together. We built software, we patent new things, and we attend conferences around the world to learn even more.\\n\\nAmazon Aurora is an exciting new area of innovation for AWS, and the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is the newest part of it, built on one of the cleanest code bases in the open source community. The PostgreSQL-compatible version of Amazon Aurora is a new relational database which offers enterprise-class performance, availability and durability - all at open source prices - to our customers, along with the management benefits of RDS. We’re a relatively new team in Database Services, one of the fastest growing businesses within Amazon Web Services. We are currently spread across Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Sydney, and Dublin. Not only do we have deep database and systems programming problems to solve for our customers, but we also minimize the effort required to maintain SQL databases by automating administrative tasks like backup / restore, scaling CPU / RAM / storage and replication / failover for high availability, allowing our customers to spend their valuable time focused on building their businesses.\\n\\nRDS for PostgreSQL runs the largest fleet of PostgreSQL databases in the world. We make regular software releases, take care of our customers, and take care of our engineers. PostgreSQL is the most advanced open source database out there, and we’re proud to contribute to its success. By combining the open source power and popularity of PostgreSQL with Amazon Web Services, for both our database engines, we think we have a winning combination for both startups and enterprises who are moving all their most important data and applications to the cloud. Check out the awesomeness of PostgreSQL at https://www.postgresql.org/.\\n\\nWe have challenging problems to solve in distributed systems, concurrency, database internals, caching, query optimization, languages, and performance engineering.

You’re as excited as we are about learning every day, and solving really hard engineering problems that no one else is.\\n\\nPassionate about software quality, repeatability, testability and maintainability, you are known to your co-workers as the go-to person for answers to questions that begin with the phrase “what’s the best way to…” – even though your answers tend to start with “help me understand what you’re trying to accomplish by…”. When you need clarity, you go to the product owner – or even a user – and talk to them until you get it. With stakeholders and other team members you are diplomatic, persuasive, and usually right. You understand the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in production, and your designs and implementations reflect that understanding.\\n\\nWhen you’re wrong, you’re happy to learn something.
