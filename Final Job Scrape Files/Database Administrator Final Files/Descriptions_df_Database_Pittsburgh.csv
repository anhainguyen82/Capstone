23,Director of Facilities Technologies - Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,"Pittsburgh, PA",Pittsburgh,PA,None Found,None Found,"Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or relevant field required.
Minimum five years of program management, information technology project management, and/or leadership experience required.",None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) provides university, government and industrial researchers with access to several of the most powerful systems for high-performance computing, communications and data storage available to scientists and engineers nationwide for unclassified research. We advance state of the art high-performance computing, communications and data analytics. It is supported by several federal agencies, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a leading partner in XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment), the National Science Foundation cyberinfrastructure program. At any given time, we provide access to high performance computing resources for several thousand academic researchers throughout the country.

We are seeking a Director of Facilities Technology. In this role, you will be responsible for directing all operations for PSC high-performance computing and storage resources, as well as planning, design, deployment, installation, maintenance and operation of future high performance computing (HPC) systems. Current supercomputing resources include Bridges and Anton2 as well as the Brain Image Library and HuBMAP converged infrastructures (see https://www.psc.edu/resources).

Such HPC systems embody novel, innovative, state-of-the-art high performance characteristics not found in typical IT systems. Examples are high performance interconnects such as Omni-Path & Infiniband, parallel filesystems such as Lustre & BeeGFS, heterogeneous clusters with high performance processor nodes of varying capabilities including dense GPUs,, advanced job scheduling software requiring development of complicated scheduling algorithms, etc. Often these components are the first of their kind and require active collaboration with vendors beginning well before product release and extremely skillful problem-solving work just to make them work. PSC’s primary computer room is located miles away from the main staff offices and is run as a nearly “dark shop” with a single staff member typically on site.

Core responsibilities will include:
Leading approximately 16 staff members, including system administrators; PSC’s advanced systems group, database information resources group, and staff that manage the facilities that house PSC’s large-scale systems report to this role.While staff is based within the CMU campus, the ability to manage a minority of remote employees will be necessary. You will advise the Executive, Center Directors and Chief Scientist in planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting and budgeting for the technology area of PSC.
Directing upgrades, maintenance and ongoing operations of systems.
Taking an active role in initiating and preparing grant proposals to seek funding for future systems. Knowledge and ability to evaluate upcoming novel and evolving computing and file system technologies is critical. In addition to these hardware technologies, you will evaluate legacy, commercial, open-source, and locally developed software technologies.
Working with managers and groups within PSC that are not directly connected to the technology area, including advanced networking, security, public health applications, and computational biology.
You should demonstrate:
Supervisory and leadership skills
Excellent problem solving skills
Ability to balance conflicting priorities
Ability to communicate clearly and work in a team environment including working with vendors of HPC hardware and software and with representatives of other HPC centers
Contribute directly to the planning and preparation of funding agency proposals for new HPC systems; advise and counsel to senior researchers and principal investigators on complementary projects
Ability to analyze a system, determine areas in need of improvement and implement solutions to improve the reliability, security and integrity of the system
In-depth knowledge of and work experience with Linux and competency with other UNIX variants
Scripting proficiency in Bash, Python and/or Perl
High degree of knowledge in administering HPC production systems
High degree of knowledge of data management software and parallel file systems
Familiarity with grid computing software, advanced job scheduling software and other software systems needed in an HPC environment
Ability to recognize patterns of faults
Ability to contribute to preparation of funding proposals, annual reports, scientific papers and presentations
General familiarity with Windows and Apple Mac OS X
Flexibility, excellence, and passion are vital qualities within PSC. Inclusion, collaboration and cultural sensitivity are valued competencies at CMU. Therefore, we are in search of a team member who is able to effectively interact with a varied population of internal and external partners at a high level of integrity. We are looking for someone who shares our values and who will support the mission of the university through their work.
