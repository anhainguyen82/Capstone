Professional students have emergent needs that must be addressed immediately (e.g., personal crises, injuries, last-minute deadlines), some of which may require consultation with (or intervention between) administrators and faculty. For example, missing deadlines could damage student career opportunities when providing recommendations for externships and residencies. The employee also must develop and maintain an institution-wide perspective when dealing with policy or procedural concerns and be able to make judgment calls concerning student, staff, and faculty matters, in addition to successfully addressing and resolving issues involving all parties.

UW Medicine’s Information Technology Services (ITS) department is a shared services organization that supports all of UW Medicine. UW Medicine is comprised of Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Northwest Hospital & Medical Center (NWH), Valley Medical Center (VMC), UW Medical Center (UWMC), UW Neighborhood Clinics (UWNC), UW Physicians (UWP), UW School of Medicine (SOM) and Airlift Northwest (ALNW). In addition, UW Medicine shares in the ownership and governance of Children’s University Medical Group and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (a partnership between UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research and Seattle Children’s). ITS is responsible for the ongoing support and maintenance of the infrastructure and applications which support all of these institutions, along with the implementation of new services and applications that are used to support and further the UW Medicine mission.


The Analytics Group has a dual report into both ITS and UW School of Medicine and provides operational oversight for the major analytics platforms and tools at UW Medicine, and is a key support function as UW Medicine transitions towards value based health care. The Analytics Group is comprised of the Analytics Consulting Team, the Enterprise Development team and the Analytics Data Operations (DataOps) Team. These teams provide solutions across UW Medicine, although specifically for finance, operations, institutional quality improvement, research and clinical analytics. The Analytics DataOps Team is responsible for the end to end platforms supporting the data solutions we provide for enterprise data warehouse, reporting, visualization and decision support. The platforms include Epic Cogito, Microsoft SQL Server, Caradigm Intelligence Platform, Change Healthcare financial support and reporting tools, BOE, and Tableau, with ongoing efforts to consolidate and simplify this stack.


The Analytics Group is seeking an experienced technology manager to fill the role of Analytics DataOps Manager (‘Manager’) in the midst of this transformation. The ideal candidate will have strong change management and technology team management abilities, with an excellent customer service mindset. Ideally, the candidate will have experience in ITIL/service management, application administration, Lean process improvement, Agile development and system consolidation. This Manager will need a high EQ and strong coaching abilities to assist in managing the many team changes throughout this process, with a minimal amount of disruption. The technical teams are highly competent, so technical direction is less critical, however the ability to ask good technical questions, challenge assumptions and learn quickly are vital. In addition, it will be helpful for the candidate to have a technical background in database management, reporting and visualization, cloud (Microsoft Azure preferrred), data delivery, and/or healthcare data.


This position will collaborate with the business and clinical partners across UW Medicine to develop solutions that will support analysis of financial, operational, and strategic activities. The Manager needs to work with the many different partners, prioritize requests, communicate status and progress, and work across the organization to solve problems. The Manager will need to work with the technical operations teams at UWM ITS and UW IT, and with vendors to identify improvements to our services and opportunities to reduce costs overall. ITS is moving towards more ITIL-based operational processes and the Manager will need to define internal operational and service level agreements, as well as improve processes to meet these agreements. The position requires creativity and the ability to suggest innovative solutions to business problems. The Manager needs to manage multiple technical teams to optimize the collection and delivery of data across the enterprise.

ITS also has a PMO, as well as Change Management and Release teams. The Manager will need to collaborate with all of these teams to align with their processes and demands. The Manager will also need to work with the many different business customers to organize their requests, communicate status and progress, set priorities and provide training. Finally, the Manager will need to support executive and operational governance groups and processes.

UW Medicine is in the midst of several transformational programs which are changing the overall platforms for patient care and financial management, and Analytics is an active participant in those activities. In addition, the Analytics team is embarking on the development of a modern data warehouse and pursuing a cloud strategy where appropriate. The future analytics platform will undoubtedly look substantially different from our current state, and there is considerable change occurring across the multiple teams. The manager will need to manage technical teams throughout these changes, while proactively seeking out opportunities for greater efficiencies and effectiveness.


Data analytics is a strategic function within UW Medicine with a large set of growing demands. The ability to deliver improved analytics, faster and at a lower cost is essential to both tactical and strategic success of UW Medicine overall. This role provides crucial support to UW Medicine and its partners for all of the major initiatives that require visualization or dashboards to deliver information to all levels of the organization and affect change.

","Overview
Though 9 in 10 Latino young adults say a college degree is important for success in life, fewer than 15% age 25 or older hold a bachelor’s degree. Voices College-Bound Language Academies exist to change that.
Founded in 2006 by East San Jose native and National Board Certified Teacher Frances Teso, Voices is a public charter school network with a mission to prepare all students for the challenges of higher education through the context of an academically rigorous dual-language program. With the Voices dual-immersion model, students receive 80% of instruction in Spanish and 20% in English starting in kindergarten. The percentages shift by 10% per year until reaching 50:50 in third grade. As a result, every student, regardless of home language, graduates bilingual and biliterate in English and Spanish.
In 2019-20, Voices will operate four public charter schools: Voices-Franklin McKinley (K-8), Voices-Morgan Hill and Voices-Mt. Pleasant (both Transitional Kindergarten - 5th, growing to Transitional Kindergarten - 8th) and Voices West Contra Costa (Transitional Kindergarten- 3rd). As we expand to serve more traditionally underserved students in Santa Clara County and surrounding counties, Voices seeks additional team members who share a commitment to its mission and believe joyful learning and world-class academic preparation are not mutually exclusive.
Voices Academies’ Vision
All students graduating from Voices College-Bound Language Academies will possess the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed in any career path they choose to pursue in life by mastering academic standards and subject matter. Students will be aware of the many positive possibilities for their future, and enjoy learning throughout their lives.

The applications we build have to not only integrate into the existing software in these industries but have to talk to each other so really drive the value from AI. Turns out, we are one of the pioneers here charting a new course. This means that science behind building the software and the AI behind it has not settled. You will be part of a team that is charting this new course figuring out how to adapt software engineering best practices to delivering AI applications that fit within legacy software in non-tech industries.

The SMQ team ensures infrastructure uptime, provisioning, and configuration of datastores (postgres, mongo, redis, elasticsearch, S3) and queuing systems (SQS, RabbitMQ) for PlanGrid engineering teams. A big part of our job is enabling developers to have visibility into their service’s performance by means of metrics, traces, and logging. Our team handles complex architectural projects to allow us to grow internationally, handle datacenter-level regional disaster recovery, and implement self-healing infrastructure across many AWS regions.

The SMQ team was formed to help focus on larger initiatives for the ever-growing Infrastructure Engineering umbrella. In the last year, we’ve re-architected the monolithic postgres database drastically reducing data loss and recovery times. We also lead efforts to reduce the operational burden provisioning and configuring new RDS databases with solid observability in place. We also test disaster recovery scenarios quarterly to verify backups and restores and expose weaknesses within our architecture.

We adhere to a devops methodology (as opposed to old-school operations) where developers - not operations people - are responsible for their code’s reliable operation and where developers are empowered and trusted to make the changes necessary for reliability. Our work focuses on data stores and message queueing systems but widely touches every layer of infrastructure and development lifecycle. We love people who define success in terms of SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs, who care deeply about observability in distributed systems, who educate people on the intricacies of complex database architectures, and who have experience scaling out large database systems to multiple regions worldwide.

You should be passionate about getting in front of problems instead of waiting until things are on fire. If you dream of stability, love metrics, communicate well, document your code, and love building reliable systems that hum along and take care of themselves, we want you on the team.

In your first 6 months on the SRE team, you will:
Help build out new AWS regions and ensure observability and good RPO/RTO
Automate our failover processes for our monolithic postgres database
Research AWS Aurora as a replacement to our RDS and EC2 postgres databases
Research and design new systems to enable developer teams to test application database load before reaching production.
