Description
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.
A research opportunity is currently available in the Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases (DFWED) in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch (EDLB) mission is to contribute to the preparedness and response to foodborne and diarrheal diseases in the United States and abroad by facilitating laboratory detection, identification and characterization of enteric bacterial pathogens. Under the guidance of a mentor, the selected participant will have the opportunity to learn how to use the NARMS database, how to organize and manage electronic database upload, storage, and quality control of antimicrobial susceptibility. The participant will also learn how to use other Specimen Management System such as ELIMS.
The participant will have the opportunity to learn about antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods, including broth microdilution, disk diffusion, Etest methods. The participant will also learn how to use the oCelloScope, the new antimicrobial susceptibility testing assay that was optimized in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Laboratory. It’s a life cell imaging system for monitoring of biological growth and development that will help us understand behavior of strains in response to antimicrobial drugs. Optical screening for rapid antimicrobial testing using the oCelloScope provides a new approach for rapidly detecting phenotypic antimicrobial resistance as an accurate and sensitive antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) method for assessment of in vitro activity of antibiotics. It’s an easy-to-use automated microscope facilitating high-throughput testing and robust time-lapse studies. It also facilitates capturing the early stages in microbial growth that could not otherwise be detected with conventional OD measurements.
This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and CDC. The initial appointment can be up to one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of CDC contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at CDC in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. Participants do not become employees of CDC, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

We believe in doing the right thing, making good and rebuilding when things go wrong. Everyone is encouraged to think creatively, challenge the status quo and look for solutions.
Scratch beneath the surface and you will find a business that is solid, but slightly contrary. We like to do things differently and constantly seek to evolve. We might have been around for a long time (our roots go back to 1901), but we are young in many ways, ambitious and going places.
Some people might say insurance is dull, but life at Hiscox is anything but. If that sounds good to you, get in touch.
