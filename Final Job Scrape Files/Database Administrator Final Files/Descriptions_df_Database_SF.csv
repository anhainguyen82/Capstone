Zinier is a global company headquartered in San Mateo, California, with offices in Mexico City, Singapore, and Bengaluru and backed by leading investors including Accel Partners and Founders Fund.
Why we exist
Services shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.
For organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.
To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.

Venmo was founded on the principles of breaking down the intimidating barriers around financial transactions to make them intuitive, friendly, and even fun. And it worked: people love sending money with Venmo, and we're growing by leaps and bounds!

But we're only just getting started. We want to take that magic of sending money with Venmo and cascade it into every place where people use money. That means connecting people to their money in the most intuitive and fun way possible, then connecting people with each other. Users already love Venmo, but we know there are lots of things we haven't thought of to make the experience of using Venmo even more delightful and valuable. All that's going to take a lot of figuring out. Let's figure it out together!

A big part of our job is enabling developers to have visibility into their service’s performance by means of metrics, traces, and logging.

Preferred Qualifications

Oracle Database Security Development Group is the core security group in Oracle. The team developed a variety of core security products in Oracle Database Kernel.

Oracle Databases hold the majority of the world’s relational data, and are attractive targets for attackers seeking high-value targets for data theft. Compromise of a single Oracle Database can result in tens of millions of breached records costing millions in breach-mitigation activity. Safeguard your most valuable data with Oracle’s powerful preventive and detective security controls, including transparent data encryption, encryption key management, privileged user and multi-factor access control, data classification and discovery, database activity monitoring and blocking, consolidated auditing and reporting, and data masking. With Oracle, you can deploy reliable data-security solutions that require no changes to existing applications, saving time and money.


Oracle Advanced Security provides two important preventive controls to protect sensitive data at the source: encryption and redaction. Together, these two controls form the foundation of Oracle's defense-in-depth, multi-layered database security solution.


Transparent Data Ecryption (TDE) stops would-be attackers from bypassing the database and reading sensitive information directly from storage by enforcing data-at-rest encryption in the database layer.


Data Redaction complements TDE by reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure in applications, redacting sensitive data before it leaves the database.
Authenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security. Passwords are the most common means of authentication. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including SSL with digital certificates.
Oracle Advanced Security team works on all layers of the database kernel stack and provide advanced security products for customers.

Job Description
You will be a key contributor in designing and implementing major pieces of the core database infrastructure for security.
You will design major core data-security products that work with replication, data high availability, and disaster recovery, Implement database techniques and features to support service scalability, performance and stability. You will design core security products related to data access control, database privileges control, data encryption, encryption key management, network encryption, database authentication, and data redaction.
Job Requirements
MS/PhD degree in CS
6+ years of experience in software engineering, preferably in security products development.
Strong development experience with C or C++ is required
Familiarity with information security concepts like SSL/TLS, Kerberos, windows authentication
