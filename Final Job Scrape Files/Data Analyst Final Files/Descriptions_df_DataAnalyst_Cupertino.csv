Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Our financial system is fundamentally unfair for people who live paycheck to paycheck. People shouldn't have to wait weeks to get the pay they've already earned. This wait forces them to spend more than $100 billion a year on short-term credit products, late fees and overdraft fees.

Earnin helps people overcome this unfairness by giving them real-time access to their money as soon as they have worked -- without fees or interest.

Our team is bound together by a desire to level the financial playing field. Our investors, Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners and March Capital believe we will change the world.

It also has a large and direct impact on the financial lives of its users.

118,Sr. Manager/ Principal Data Analyst - Risk,"Palo Alto, CA",Palo Alto,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"About Earnin:
Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.

About the Team:
Business decisions at Earnin rely heavily on good analysis. Autonomous, cross-functional product and operational teams (we call them ""pods"") drive these decisions on a day to day basis. You'll help a group of pods make product decisions by providing them with insights from our data. For success in this role, you'll need to be comfortable diving deep into the data, owning your analysis, and communicating your insights in an accessible way.

The Risk Pod sits at the heart of Earnin. As the owners of the core business metrics, Risk powers the financial engine that allows Earnin to constantly deliver value to our community. Our Risk team has taken a unique approach to risk management, portfolio management, and interacting with our community members.

This position will give you ample opportunity to use and enhance your analytics skills and be hands-on with a complex product in an interesting market. We're in the process of building out our analytics capabilities, so you'll also have a chance to shape the methods and tools that we use. Our business has interesting characteristics for analysis, e.g. lack of a fixed price or term, heavy dependency on external events and providers, and a very data-rich environment. It also has a large and direct impact on the financial lives of its users.

This role has the potential for massive impact on Earnin's growth trajectory. If you have a passion for helping people and a background in data, we want to hear from you!

A mission to improve the financial lives of folks who need help
Exceptional product-market fit with NPS scores in the 80s
