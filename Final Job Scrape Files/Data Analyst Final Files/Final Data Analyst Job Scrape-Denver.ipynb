Are you interesting in learning what drives sales for any ecommerce business, using advanced digital data analysis techniques? Would you enjoy the excitement – and riskiness – associated with handling hundreds of thousands of dollars when trading digital media on the clients’ behalf? Would you like to develop an analytical, media, technical and business skillset that will allow you to ultimately ascend to leadership positions at any brand that has online presence?\\nWe are looking for candidates for Data Analyst / Media Trader Positions, at DELVE, a #1-rated Google Analytics and DoubleClick Partner.
