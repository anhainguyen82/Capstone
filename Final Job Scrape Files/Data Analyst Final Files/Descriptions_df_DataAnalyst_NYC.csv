DaisyBill Mission
-----------------------

Workers' Comp Made Better
-------------------------------

If you are injured at work, most industrialized countries establish workers' compensation systems that require your employer to provide for all of your care and treatment while you recover. In the United States, each state sets up its own workers' compensation rules for employers to assume financial responsibility for your care.

The world would be a better place if injured employees could access the best medical treatment and services. Unfortunately, the complexities of workers' comp often frustrate and discourage medical providers; as a result, many providers refuse to treat employees injured while at work.

DaisyBill is built for these providers and eliminates many of the frustrating complexities that burden the process of getting paid by employers for the services and treatment needed by injured employees.

Our clients are our number one priority; they stay with us because we constantly keep our clients top of mind as we develop technology to make their workers' comp billing world so much easier and better. We adore our clients and our clients adore us -- they make DaisyBill the best at what we do.

DaisyBill was founded in 2012 and is an established and profitable niche enterprise B2B technology company. We preserve many of the benign characteristics that fueled our early start-up days but without the worries of answering to outside equity.

The DaisyBill Team devotes all of our collective expertise, talent, and resources to the pursuit of our mission of improving injured employees' access to the very best medical care.

As one of the most exciting and unique candidates in the Democratic presidential race, entrepreneur Andrew Yang sets out to bridge the divide in American society. In 2011, he founded Venture for America, an entrepreneurial non-profit that helped create 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh.

Once Andrew realized that new technology, such as artificial intelligence, threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs, he knew he had to do something. In The War on Normal People (2018), he explains the mounting crisis and makes the case for implementing a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult: no strings attached. Most importantly, Andrew Yang understands that the future of America is not left, not right, but forward.

49,Public Data Research Analyst,"New York, NY",New York,NY,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"About the job:

The Public Data Research Analyst will build informative analytical content using public data drawn from our platform, as well as broader research to help put that data in context.
At Vigilant, we build tools for transparency, helping our customers drive accountability and reduce risk. There are exciting stories to be told about the data our platform unlocks, and about the ways our customers use it. Some examples of this might include in-depth analyses of campaign finance trends, or mapping out lobbying trends across all 50 states.
Thoughtful analysis and impactful research is the core of the role. You'll create useful content that is referenced and shared - bringing forward new insights and leveraging public data sets to tell these stories. This content will support our team's marketing efforts - generating informative reports and whitepapers, blog posts, email alerts, infographics, and more.
What you'll do:
Develop analytical and editorial content around public data that adds insight and delivers value for readers
Develop and enhance company marketing materials and collateral
Expand and enhance our website and digital presence with analytical content
Grow our audience and email list
Help generate press coverage and pick-up through distribution of analytical content
Provide support for company's broader data strategy
Must-have skills/experiences:
You have 1-3 years professional experience in journalism (particularly data-driven beats), political research, analyst roles, or similar
You have strong familiarity with public data and government records and are adept at understanding and explaining these data sources
You have previous experience writing blogs, reports, and analytical content
You love great copy and clear and informative communication

Knowledge of website analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics)
Experience with marketing automation tools like Hubspot or Mailchimp
Experience with Adobe InDesign or similar software
CRM Experience (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive)
About you:
Clear communicator. You'll be helping customers and leads understand the kind of problems we can help them solve, and how the solutions we offer work, so you need to be able to articulate value clearly
Analytical thinker. You're great at breaking down complex problems into a series of clear components, and understanding how they intersect.
Ability and interest in grokking different industries and use cases. You're excited to do the research to develop a deep understanding of different subjects. You probably do this on your own, anyway.
Broadly Creative. You're good at seeing how different - and often disparate - details might be combined to form something bigger and brighter.

Vigilant's Values:
Constant learning and insatiable curiosity. We organize information, and we're always keen to know more. We're committed to learning and growth and enjoy working with those who share that commitment.
We're guided by a deep empathy for our customers and their needs. We think carefully about how our users - and our world - may be affected by the decisions we make. We're constantly aiming to drive improvements for our users.
We aim high. We're taking on large, difficult problems, and are looking to build meaningful solutions and scale a substantial company that will have lasting impact. Ambition is a compliment in our book.
Relentless tenacity. We do the work. We tend to see obstacles as things to overcome. When we decide to do something, we work at it until it gets done.
Real humility. We recognize that we don't have all the answers, or even most of them. That gives us the space to learn.
We draw the owl. We're growing, and there isn't usually a defined set of instructions for any given task. We figure it out. We work, iterate, and improve. (In the interest of full disclosure, we shamelessly borrowed this notion from Twilio's corporate values).
We take ownership and have a bias towards action. If we notice an issue is affecting the business, we work to fix it immediately, even if it's not in our wheelhouse.
We save our paperclips. We have an ownership mentality and act in the company's best interest. We're conscious of how our actions and behavior impact the business and the company's bottom line. We celebrate efficient solutions.
We follow through. We do what we say. We get the job done."

About ECD in Emergency & Conflict
The global refugee crisis is the defining humanitarian issue of our time, with millions displaced due to conflict and war across the Middle East and the world. In addition, we know from decades of research that all children need nurturing care, a comforting routine, and opportunities to learn through play in the critical first years of life. Yet only about 2 percent of humanitarian assistance goes to education and only a tiny sliver of that 2 percent to early childhood development services. In partnership with Sesame Workshop, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), and BRAC, NYU Global TIES for Children has set out to develop, provide and evaluate high-quality early childhood development services and mass media for young children in the Syrian response region and Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, the most recent recipient of a large influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. This unique partnership was awarded a USD $100 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation, the first to be given under the 100& Change initiative, for the Syrian response, and the US $100 million for the Rohingya response in Bangladesh. NYU Global TIES for Children will be leading the independent research and external evaluation of this project, including a longitudinal study, implementation research as well as impact evaluations. We strive to bring the most rigorous qualitative and quantitative evidence to bear on how to best serve families and children in these communities. We will pay special attention to issues of stress and adversity; issues of gender and disability; as well as the diversity of cultures in these two contexts of both refugees and host communities. The project team at TIES is led by Hirokazu Yoshikawa (Principal Investigator), Alice J. Wuermli (Co-Principal Investigator and Research Director). J. Lawrence Aber is serving as a co-Investigator for the Middle East part of the project. Research activities are coordinated with research partners at the IRC and Sesame Workshop. The project includes local partners and expert collaborators from around the world.
Position Summary
The Research Associate/Data Analyst will be responsible for assisting the Project Director and Research Scientists with data collection (e.g., coding tablets to facilitate smooth, clean transfer of data from the field), data verification, management, and analysis tasks. The position includes providing research support for several different impact evaluations and studies simultaneously. Key tasks include instrument design, data cleaning, organization, analysis (including but not limited to psychometric analyses), and interpretation as well as assisting with the dissemination of findings (e.g., writing up of results into reports and academic journal articles). The majority of the work will be quantitative in nature but the ideal candidate should feel comfortable triangulating between theory, empirical findings, and qualitative findings.
Position Responsibilities
The Research Associate/Data Analyst is responsible for active involvement in all stages of data analysis, including:
Instrument design and testing
Data quality check, cleaning, and management
Supporting and advising on analysis planning and modeling decisions
Conducting data analysis
Writing methodological approaches and analysis findings into reports and academic journal articles
Training and supervising volunteers and temporary research assistants
If Arabic fluent, assisting with translation and interpretation of Arabic language materials
The Research Associate/Data Analyst will report directly to Drs. Hiro Yoshikawa and Alice Wuermli and work closely with NYU faculty members (including Dr. Larry Aber) as well as researchers and practitioners at TIES, IRC, and Sesame Workshop.

Together with our key strategic partner organizations, our work leverages cutting-edge scientific methods and interdisciplinary collaboration to:
Generate actionable evidence to promote child and youth development by conducting and evaluating powerful strategies to transform relevant “social settings” (i.e., classrooms, schools, families, communities, etc.) that are key drivers of children’s learning and well-being;
Communicate actionable evidence by engaging diverse stakeholders across sectors and regions and disseminating a rigorous evidence base to inform program and policy decisions for children and youth in LI and CA countries; and
Build human, administrative, and institutional capacity for robust global science and practice through the provision of professional development and training activities.
