What You’ll Do:

Experimentation: Develop test plans, define success metrics, and ensure accurate results methodologically, technically, and statistically. Lead research efforts to inform the content team of outside trends and offerings to drive strategy as needed. Design controlled experiments to test hypotheses about new features or content offerings.
Goaling and KPIs: Work “full-stack” to define KPIs and goal metrics with cross-functional stakeholders, forecast outcomes, and measure pacing against those targets.
Business Performance Reporting, Visualization, and Regression Management: Be the primary partner for cross-functional stakeholders to understand the performance of content on the platform. When content engagement is ahead or behind expectations, dig in to drive meaningful, actionable insights that help the business performance improve or double-down on success.
Deep-Dive Analysis: Analyze user behavioral data to identify patterns, uncover opportunities, and create a common understanding of how people are interacting with the platform and content. Develop frameworks that improve our understanding of Glo users and effectively communicate learnings across the content team.
Reporting and Roadmapping: Transform large volumes of data into digestible reports and actionable insights. Collaborate with Data Engineers to build and maintain optimal dashboards (i.e. Tableau), and create SQL queries to support rapid decision making. Own the design, development, validation, and maintenance of ongoing metrics, reports, analyses, experiments and related roadmaps to drive content decisions.
Forecasting and Opportunity Sizing: Both to set goals and help evaluate potential opportunities, this analyst will be tasked with forecasting and opportunity sizing. This will help business stakeholders evaluate trade-offs in different approaches, and create targets for driving business performance.
Partnership: Partner closely with business stakeholders to identify and unlock opportunities, and with other data teams to improve platform capabilities around data modeling, testing platforms, data visualization, and data architecture. Work closely with Data Engineers to ensure adequate data is available for analysis, and collaborate with engineering and platform teams to implement, QA, and monitor our logging and metrics.

About You:

Creative: Statistical analysis is only one part of the job. You have a creative spirit: one that pushes to experiment, remain flexible, and solve problems with a new, fresh perspective.
Collaborative: Although there’s plenty of solo work time, you have the ability to share knowledge and collaborate as a team member.
Curious: You look for the meaning—the “why”—behind the numbers. With an insatiable drive to discover actionable insights, you are constantly ask questions and search for solutions. Curiosity fuels you and the possibility of failure doesn’t scare you.
Strategic: While you know how to dig deep and get lost in the data, you also have the ability to think beyond a tactical level. With a “big picture” outlook, you can keep both the client’s goals and the end customers in mind.
Communicator: You understand how to transform meaningful data into digestible insights and how to communicate those insights to a wide range of audiences—everyone from the content and creative team to the IT department. By distilling the data into something simple, something people can believe in, you have the ability to communicate learnings in a way that makes people care.
Learner: You understand that data analysis goes far beyond number-crunching. New technology, tools and theories require you to stay up-to-date by attending industry events, reading widely and making connections. You are a proactive thinker who thrives off of being challenged, day in and day out.
Technical Expert: Finally, you have the technical chops that can only come from years of work as a Data Analyst. You can perform critical analysis with awareness of your own bias or expectation, as well as a deep understanding of tools, formulas and models that comes from hands-on experience.

One of the best ways to learn the about the work in policies, programs and services around for people experiencing homelessness is through an internship program. LAHSA is looking for bright, self-motivated, energetic individuals who are interested in learning the dynamics of working in a government agency. Through this program, students are involved in meaningful, productive work while energizing our organization with fresh ideas. While students can gain credit hours to apply towards their education and licensing, internships are also a great recruiting tool that allows LAHSA to train potential future employees.

Our internship program runs year-round depending upon availability of projects, resources and need. Both paid and un-paid internships are available. Paid internships will be advertised and recruited individually, with scope and stipend listed within the employment classification.

LAHSA strives to keep the local community connected with the work taking place throughout the continuum. This is accomplished through community-based events, policy advocacy, correspondence and everyday involvement with the Los Angeles Continuum of Care (CoC). As an intern you may provide support to staff with special events, policy and research, program design, homeless programs and services, and special projects related to the mission of reducing homelessness. The goal is to establish a workable and mutually beneficial learning environment.

The internship program is designed to help students develop knowledge and understanding of the common principles, functions and practices related to working in a public agency. Although unpaid, interns receive important benefits like working directly with staff, elected officials, and community leaders on issues and events related homelessness in additional to gaining valuable skills and experience in the professional work environment. Interns may also qualify for educational credit from their college or university.
