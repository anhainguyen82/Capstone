Local Burden of Disease: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.

Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.


Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.


Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.


Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.


Responsibilities include:

Our people are the most important asset in our pursuit of achieving excellence in education, research, and community service. Our staff not only enjoys outstanding benefits and professional growth opportunities, but also an environment noted for diversity, community involvement, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits, and natural beauty.


The University of Washington’s Department of Biostatistics has an outstanding opportunity for a limited term Data Analyst.


The Genetic Analysis Center (GAC, www.biostat.washington.edu/research/centers/gac) in the Department of Biostatistics develops and applies statistical methods to genetic and health-related data to discover how genetic variants contribute to human well-being and disease. The genetic data include variations assayed by whole-genome sequencing and microarrays, while the health data cover a broad range of traits, including complex diseases such as diabetes, asthma, atherosclerosis, and cancer, as well as quantitative traits such as hematological and lipid measurements. Projects are funded by various parts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), but also non-profits and industry. Current major projects include operating as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program (www.nhlbiwgs.org) and serving as Data Stewards for the NHLBI DataSTAGE (https://www.nhlbidatastage.org/).


The TOPMed program is a cutting-edge initiative to identify genetic risk factors for heart, lung, and blood diseases using whole-genome sequencing and other ‘-omic’ assays, such as metabolomics, proteomics, methylomics, and transcriptomics. The GAC is the TOPMed DCC, which provides TOPMed with quality control of genomic data, harmonization of clinical phenotypes across studies, genotype-phenotype association analysis, as well as interpretation, reporting, and training on findings. The GAC also works to develop new statistical methodology and software for integrative analysis of multi-omic and clinical data in large samples.


The NHLBI DataSTAGE project is focused on developing and testing a cloud-based platform where investigators can store, share, access, and analyze large-scale biomedical data in a secure environment.

Write and execute R and/or Python code for analysis of large data sets efficiently using parallel computing, both locally and in a cloud environment.

Develop, package, and document code/software for use by GAC staff.

Work collaboratively with other GAC staff to support statistical methods development.

Follow standards for reproducible research.


Training for these activities will be provided through working closely with experienced team members. The GAC provides a highly collaborative and collegial environment in which team members across the group share expertise and mentor each other.


REQUIREMENTS:


Minimum: Master’s in a quantitative scientific field such as biostatistics, statistics, bioinformatics, quantitative genetics, epidemiology, mathematics, or computer science

Minimum work experience: 1 year

Proficiency in R and/or Python

Experience in management, analysis, and interpretation of large and complex scientific data sets
