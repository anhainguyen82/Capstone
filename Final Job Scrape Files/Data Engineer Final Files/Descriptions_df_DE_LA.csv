About the job
Using and understanding natural language is at the core of Google's technologies. Linguists at Google guide, build, and innovate methodologies around discourse and pragmatics, semantic analysis and representation, syntactic and morphological parsing, lexicon development, speech recognition and synthesis, text classification, ontology development, and human computation. Current areas of focus include dialogue systems, NLU, personalization, product evaluation, and data collection.
You'll collaborate with Researchers, Data Scientists, and Engineers to produce analyses and high quality data that improve our ability to understand and generate natural language in a variety of contexts. Many linguists focus on one or more languages in which they have special expertise, and propose directions and solutions to language-specific problems.
