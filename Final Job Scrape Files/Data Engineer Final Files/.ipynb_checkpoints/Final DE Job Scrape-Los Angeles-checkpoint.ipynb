       "0    Los Angeles, California\\nData Science and Engineering\\nNetflix is a pioneer in the entertainment industry, merging the creativity of Hollywood with the technical innovation of Silicon Valley. Netflix currently serves over 150 million subscribers in more than 190 countries around the world and spent over $12 billion on television, films, documentaries and other entertainment content in 2018 alone.\\n\\nAs Netflix continues to grow - we are leveraging the unique position we have as both a content distributor and producer to create cutting-edge data driven insights to support a variety of people making decisions about the content we make and buy.\\n\\nWe’re looking for a senior software engineer to help build new tools to help us become the first truly data-driven content studio in the world. You’ll work closely with data scientists to create interactive web applications that will not only surface critical insights to business and creative stakeholders, but collect critical information from key decision makers to allow us to continually learn and innovate around the ways we discover and evaluate new content.\\nYou Are:\\nExperienced building full-stack web apps. You have deep experience with Node.js and front-end JavaScript. You have experience working with a component framework like React or Vue.js.
