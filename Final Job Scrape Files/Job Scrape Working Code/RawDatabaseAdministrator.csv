DEFINITION

Under general supervision or direction, performs a diverse range of professional, analytical duties in the design, engineering, enhancement, administration, and maintenance of County information technology servers and related systems, including server hardware and core infrastructure applications; analyzes customer and enterprise infrastructure client/server systems requirements; develops and maintains department and enterprise infrastructure client/server architectures; and performs related duties as assigned.

SUPERVISION RECEIVED AND EXERCISED

Receives general supervision or direction from assigned supervisory or management personnel. Exercises no direct supervision over staff but may lead the work of staff on assigned projects.

CLASS CHARACTERISTICS

Information Technology Analyst I – Server Design and Administration: This is the entry-level classification in the Information Technology Analyst – Server Design and Administration class series. Initially under general supervision, incumbents learn the operational aspects of the County's information technology architecture as well as its core hardware and software platforms. As experience is gained, assignments become more varied, complex, and difficult, and the degree of supervision and frequent review of work lessens as an incumbent demonstrates skill to perform the work independently. Positions at this level usually perform most of the duties required of the positions at the II-level, but are not expected to function at the same skill level and usually exercise less independent discretion and judgment in matters related to work procedures and methods. Work is usually supervised while in progress and fits an established structure or pattern. Exceptions or changes in procedures are explained in detail as they arise.

Information Technology Analyst II – Server Design and Administration: This is the fully qualified journey-level classification in the Information Technology Analyst – Server Design and Administration class series where incumbents perform the full range of server design, engineering, enhancement, administration, and maintenance. Positions at this level are distinguished from the I-level by the performance of the full range of duties, working independently, and exercising judgment and initiative. Positions at this level receive only occasional instruction or assistance as new or unusual situations arise and are fully aware of the operating procedures and policies of the work unit.

This class is further distinguished from the Information Technology Analyst III– Server Design and Administration in that the latter is responsible for more complex and higher-level server design and administration functions and provides lead oversight to assigned staff.

Positions in the Information Technology Analyst - Server Design and Administration class series are flexibly staffed and positions at the II-level are normally filled by advancement from the I-level after gaining the knowledge, skill, and experience which meets the qualifications for the II-level, and after demonstrating the ability to perform the work of the higher-level class.

Core Competencies




Safety
Makes sure to understand every safety practice expected by the organization. Takes no shortcuts that increase the risks of accidents, personal injuries or equipment failures. Looks for unsafe practices in the workplace and takes responsibility to ensure that others are aware of the potential impact. This is distinctly different from those who are unaware of many safety expectations, take shortcuts that increase safety risks, and/or fail to recognize and take timely action to increase safe practices by others.


Quality of Work
Has established a track record of producing work that is highly accurate, demonstrates attention to detail and reflects well on the organization. Is personally committed to high quality work and encourages others to have similar standards. This differs from those who cannot be relied upon to produce high quality work, pay little attention to detail, show little pride in a job well done and/or set a poor example for co-workers or direct reports.


Teamwork
Is an effective team player who adds complementary skills and contributes valuable ideas, opinions and feedback. Communicates in an open and candid manner and can be counted upon to fulfill any commitments made to others on the team. This is distinctly different from those who withhold ideas and opinions, offer ideas or opinions that rarely add value to team discussions, have established a track record with many unmet commitments, and/or have not contributed skills that complement the skills of others on the team.


Continuous Improvement
Finds it unacceptable when patient and customer outcomes could be improved. Takes personal responsibility for maintaining and upgrading own knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure that service delivery is safe, efficient and effective. Strives to stay abreast of new approaches to healthcare. Demonstrates full commitment to quality improvement initiatives by taking an active role, being a positive model and by encouraging others to be equally committed and accountable. Is proactive in calling attention to service delivery deficiencies or opportunities and offers concrete suggestions for improving processes and systems that affect quality of care and productivity.


Education and Self Development
Makes it a practice to take charge of self-development by soliciting feedback, setting priorities, and then acquiring or strengthening skills and knowledge through coursework or other methods. This is in distinct contrast to those who avoid, discount or ignore feedback, fail to identify self-improvement needs or resist learning opportunities as unnecessary or untimely.

Our Start
Kochava began in 2011 when a team of mobile and gaming professionals saw the need to better understand the feedback loop of user acquisition, engagement, and LTV for mobile applications. Through the process of creating apps for customers from a wide range of industries, we were repeatedly asked if we could shed some light on what media advertising efforts were converting and the effectiveness of their mobile ad spend by partner. Realizing a solution to these questions wasn’t readily available, we started designing and building a mobile measurement platform that would become Kochava.

Our HQ Location
We live and work in the wonderful ski resort town of Sandpoint, Idaho. Kochava has sales and agency representation in major markets worldwide, but we choose to grow our development and engineering infrastructure around Sandpoint, as it allows us to stay focused on cutting code while taking advantage of the community and quality of life the town offers to our team.
