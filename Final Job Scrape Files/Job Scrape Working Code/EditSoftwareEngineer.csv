Extend our API: Our customers constantly tell us how intuitive and reliable our API is. As we make our service more sophisticated, you’ll be ensuring that customers can still quickly integrate SigOpt into their workflows. Potential projects include building new RESTful endpoints and resources that connect customer needs with the research team’s algorithms.

Build Out Web App: Another project area interns work on is our React-based interface for managing and analyzing experiments. Data visualization, user management, and experiment tracking are all critical pieces of the SigOpt solution that interns extend.

Use the Best Tools: Kubernetes, Postgres, Node, Python 3, GitHub, PagerDuty, Slack. We make sure our developers have everything they need to do their best work. You'll need to be curious, and ramp up on new tools. These skills will make you a more effective engineer long term; they are worth the effort!

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data.

You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
Some of the things our Software Engineers have done:
Built a web-based mapping interface that handles millions of data points dynamically displayed at once.
Constructed an analysis platform on top of a columnar database and custom infrastructure that allows complex numerical analysis at the petabyte scale.
Built AtlasDB, which provides high-scale, reliable data storage for Palantir products. This NoSQL distributed data store adds a transactional layer that gives the whole system ACID properties.
Developed a WYSIWYG web app for quickly creating interactive, data-driven web sites.
Worked on a variety of Palantir open-source projects. Some of our favorites, available on our GitHub page, are Blueprint, Plottable, TSLint, and AtlasDB.

Pivotal's Story VIDEO' ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7APZD0me1nU )

Pivotal Software, Inc. combines platform, tools, and methodology to help the world's largest companies transform the way they build software and run their most strategic applications. Our technology is used by Global 2000 companies and developers to give software development and IT operations a strategic advantage. Founded in 2013, Pivotal unleashes software-developer productivity and creates an environment for innovation to scale, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

Our Values

We're committed to increasing representation of POCs in the tech space and would like to take a bigger step in the right direction by formalizing our investment in HBCUs as part of a broader strategy to increase diversity and inclusion at Pivotal. With a team of dedicated members and the strong support of Pivotal leadership, we're inviting new graduates to join and contribute to our unique culture of doing the right thing, doing what works, and being kind.

Us

The Pivotal Rise Program is a full time, entry level pilot program designed for graduating students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are interested in a career in engineering. Students from all HBCUs who identify with a group that is historically underrepresented in the technology industry, including but not limited to Black, Hispanic and/or Latino, Native American, students with disabilities, and veterans, are encouraged to apply.

Our vision for the Pivotal Rise Program is for participants to learn, grow, and thrive in their careers and professional communities as part of a carefully selected cohort. Through your day to day work on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Engineering Team, you will pair with senior technical engineers, and you will have the opportunity to take advantage of unique, career-changing opportunities, including: pair programming, mentorship from experienced engineers, integration into professional communities such as employee resource groups, and exposure to real software that transforms the industry. You will also have the opportunity to engage one-on-one with the Pivotal leadership team and explore long term professional development opportunities in our challenging, inclusive, and enriching environment. At Pivotal, you will find a community in your cohort, team, office, and the company at large, and we are excited for you to contribute to our unique culture of doing the right thing, doing what works, and being kind. Lastly, as part of the inaugural cohort for this pilot program, you will have a direct role in influencing the design and direction of the program itself.

At Pivotal, the opportunities afforded to you are endless based on your individual goals, aspirations and skills. We value an environment of continued learning and development. Being a part of the first cohort means you have the unique opportunity to accelerate your career and shape the future of Pivotal Rise.

You

You judge your success by the success of your team; you are interested in learning about distributed systems; and you are excited to work on open source.

You are also a part of creating and shaping the strategy for our Pivotal Rise program. You have the opportunity to impact and leave your fingerprints on the company and industry.

Your Day

As cliche as it may sound, every day is completely different from the next. We have a general framework ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvjPSz8Xs7Q ) for what our day looks like and the majority of it will be spent with your pair:

9:30-12:30 PM - Start pairing, tackle an open GitHub issue and open a pull-request.

12:30-1:30 PM - Lunch! Go for a bite, run an errand, or join a book club.

1:31-6:00 PM - Get back with your pair and start an acceptance test for a big feature.

We pair program ( https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pairing-like-a-pivot ), all-day every-day, because we know it delivers remarkable results. We work in small teams, and rotate among them frequently. We believe in working at a sustainable pace – we know there is a life outside work, and we want you to be able to spend time with family and friends.

192,"Software Engineer, Front End- Onboarding and Growth Squad",Abstract,,Remote,"About Abstract
Abstract is a design workflow platform for teams to version, manage, and collaborate on Sketch files. Since launching in July 2017, over 5,000 design teams across 75 countries have adopted Abstract, including teams from Shopify, Cisco, Intuit, Spotify, Salesforce, Instacart, OpenTable, and more.

At Abstract, we are actively working to build a diverse and inclusive organization. Here, diversity includes age, economic class, educational background, ethnic variance, familial status, gender, gender expression, gender identity, marital status, national origin, religious affiliation, sex, sexual orientation, transgender status, or veteran status.

Abstract is headquartered in San Francisco but many of our teams and roles are remote-first (US-based only at this time). If you have a passion for rolling up your sleeves, building new programs, and have a strong, team-player mentality, we’d love to hear from you!

About the Role
At Abstract we develop desktop and web applications that help teams design with confidence by providing a version control system and collaboration platform focused on design artifacts. We are looking for an engineer to help us build UI and features for our desktop and web applications.

We use modern web technologies so we can iterate quickly and also provide opportunities for our designers to chip in. Expertise in JavaScript and React is a big plus but familiarity with other modern JavaScript UI libraries (Vue, Angular, Ember) is beneficial as well. We're more interested in your ability to learn and solve problems than your specific programming language or framework experience.

In a typical week as a Front End Engineer, you will:
Discuss, plan, and build new features using JavaScript, React, and Redux.
Collaborate with designers on new React components for our growing shared component library.
Partner with Support and QA to triage and fix bugs, sometimes working directly with customers.
Contribute to server-side APIs — through code, peer review, or both — that are needed to ship features.
Participate in peer code reviews through pull requests to make sure we're moving fast while also maintaining quality code bases.
Participate in design reviews and give feedback.
Participate in our agile methodology (Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, Backlog Refining, Retrospectives).

Practical skills you'll need for success:
Experience building products and UI using modern web technologies.
An analytical mindset. You think critically about your work, ask questions, approach problems from different angles, and are excited to improve the product.
A customer-centric lens. You look forward to working with them so we can identify pain points and create solutions.
Enthusiasm to problem solve. When things inevitably break, you eagerly jump in to diagnose and fix the core issues.
Clear communication skills. You can clearly discuss and explain complex technical topics.

Bonus points if you have:
Experience with server-side languages, especially Ruby on Rails.
Worked on small teams and are comfortable wearing multiple hats every single day.

Benefits
At Abstract, we offer resources that emphasize personal and familial wellbeing. We provide 99% healthcare coverage, including dental, vision, and life insurance. We offer 10 weeks parental leave, unlimited paid-time off, and flexible working arrangements. Additional perks include dependent care and health care FSA as well as commuter benefits for SF office employees.

To help employees plan for the future, we're able to offer competitive pay and a 401k.

We are a distributed team and we are able to offer US-based remote employment for most roles. We offer travel opportunities for company meetings, team meet-ups, and the occasional conference.

Notes
In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification form upon hire. Applicants must be currently authorized to work in the United States on a full-time basis; Elastic Projects will not sponsor applicants for work visas.

323,Staff Software Engineer - Generalist,Common Networks,,"San Francisco, CA","Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

Role

We're looking for a strong generalist to join our small engineering team. We're building a new ISP from the ground up and rethinking conventional wisdom as we go. A typical week involves building everything from front end JavaScript UI to networking control plane software in Go to inventing new graph algorithms to solve problems across our mesh. We want engineers who are excited by interesting problems, who like collaborating with others and who know that perfect is the enemy of done.
What you do
Design systems and coordinate engineers to solve major business needs
Work with product owners to rapidly translate business needs into production-quality software
Investigate, explore, and master new technical topics; quickly learn new skills as necessary
Verify systems via writing test/deployment plans and automated tests
Produce exemplary documentation for systems to ensure they remain maintainable and easy to extend
Mentor junior engineers in strong software engineering discipline and practices
Proactively identify and resolve bottlenecks, address technical debt, and improve performance
Who you are
You love to code, and you’re excited to work at a place where you spend 90% of your day heads down coding.
You’re relentlessly curious. When something breaks, you’re not satisfied with surface-level explanations and proximate causes, you need to know what the underlying issue was and you’re not afraid to dig in and find out for yourself.
You enjoy working closely with other engineers, whether it’s bouncing ideas around after stand-up or mentoring new hires. You thrive in a highly collaborative environment and embrace diversity of thought and experience when thinking through your designs.
You’ve mastered your craft over many years of professional engineering. You’ve got a feel for when to quickly rush out an MVP and when to architect for years down the line. You write excellent documentation, you know how to fully explore a solution space, and you know the value of good automated tests.
Requirements
8+ years writing software professionally
Mastery of multiple programming languages (bonus if one of those is golang)
Experience leading large projects through design, implementation, and long term maintenance
Demonstrated ownership of large, mission-critical functionality
Experience with DVCS, automated testing and scaling software systems
Nice to have
Strong Linux experience
Extensive networking experience
Experience with fixed wireless networking
Experience with golang

330,Software Engineer,Instabase,,"San Francisco, CA 94104","About Instabase

Founded in 2015, Instabase's mission is to advance the state of the art by building tools that help people solve important problems, make discoveries, and create new breakthroughs.

Instabase is an operating system designed for operational efficiency. It uses the web browser as the user interface, a pluggable storage system for managing data (files and databases), and an app store for applications. These applications run on the Instabase Platform, which provides the core management capabilities for managing diverse, distributed datasets; support for collaboration and access control; and a runtime for Instabase Applications.

The applications include state of the art tools for [1] processing a diverse set of unstructured data (scanned images, PDFs, word/excel documents, emails, websites, etc.), [2] running extensible functions with a server-less framework, [3] machine learning (natural language processing, image processing, classification, clustering, etc.), and [4] data science.

Our customers include large enterprises with huge operational costs in a variety of domains, such as financial services (e.g. banks, insurance), healthcare, logistics/supply chain.

As a non-profit initiative, Instabase provides a hosted IPython-style notebook for education, which is widely used by universities (Stanford, MIT, Columbia, University of Chicago, etc.), for teaching classes. The Stanford Dean of Engineering Jennifer Widom used Instabase as the platform for her 2016-17 Instructional Odyssey, a year-long sabbatical in which she traveled the world offering free short courses in data and design.
