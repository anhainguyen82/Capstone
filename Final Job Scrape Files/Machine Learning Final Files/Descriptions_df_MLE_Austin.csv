You will work closely with Arm’s cloud data services organization, partners, and academia to identify promising nascent ideas and develop them into tomorrow’s key software systems, services, and solutions.
What will I be accountable for?

Arm Research plays a central role in identifying gaps in state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies and in conducting world-leading research to fill those gaps. You will join a research team innovating in the area of cloud-based data and machine learning (ML) platforms and services for deriving business intelligence from massive time series data. An ideal candidate will bring evidence of excellence in applied ML algorithms research who has superb knowledge of and demonstrated experience with a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe2, or MXNet.
You will be expected to identify the benefits and limitations of various algorithmic options, to generate high quality implementations of deep learning algorithms directly from pseudocode, to optimize the implementations for efficient data ingestion and distributed training on clusters of hardware-accelerated compute nodes, to rigorously validate the trained models against overfitting, and to deploy the models in containerized applications.
Your role will encompass advancing SOTA in time-series ML through contributions to open source software and development of novel algorithmic strategies, analytics systems, and ML platform components. You will be encouraged to participate in the wider community through collaborations with academia, contributions to open source software, and publications and presentations in leading ML- conferences and forums.
An ideal candidate will have following traits:

You are a hands-on ML researcher professionally invested in advancing the deep learning SOTA as evidenced in, for example, your research publications, open source software products, and the overall academic and/or professional portfolio.
You possess keen interest in ML algorithms, deep learning ecosystems, and large-scale software system design, and you closely follow the most recent trends in these areas.
You have demonstrated experience with developing and training ML models in one or more of the popular deep learning frameworks.
You have a solid understanding of the framework internals, including the linear algebra, neural network computational logic, stochastic optimization, and hardware acceleration.
You have deep experience in probabilistic reasoning and computational problem solving and a healthy dose of obsession about accuracy, reliability, robustness, and scalability. You are very comfortable diving deep into topics such as Bayesian ML, autoencoders, generative models, adversarial training, etc.
You possess the ability to see the big picture, question the norm, and articulate the problem.
You can translate relatively abstract ideas into concrete workable solutions.
You enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge technologies that may be relatively immature at the time of their use.
You are good in identifying the technology trade-offs and can synthesize pragmatic solutions to the problems at hand by judiciously leveraging published and open-source technologies.
You are a strong programmer and are not afraid to dive in large code bases. You take pride in your code and enjoy contributing to open source projects.
Job Requirements
What skills, experience, and qualifications do I need?

Advanced degree (MS or PhD) in computer science or related disciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, operations research, etc.
