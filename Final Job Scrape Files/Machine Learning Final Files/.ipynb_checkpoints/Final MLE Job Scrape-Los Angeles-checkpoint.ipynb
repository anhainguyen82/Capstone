       "      <td>Imbellus Overview\\n\\nWe are looking for exceptional people who share our mission: to reinvent how we measure human potential. At Imbellus, we build simulation-based assessments that evaluate how people think instead of what they know, for use by the education system and employers. We believe our society must prioritize developing minds that do what computers cannot. Eventually, we'll replace standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, SAT II, and AP. By changing assessments, we can reorient the education system &amp; employers towards measuring what matters.\\n\\nWe love this challenge. We're an interdisciplinary team of learning scientists, game developers, artists, AI engineers, and data scientists, looking for others who want to tackle this difficult problem. We know that what has worked for decades in other contexts, might not work in ours, so we don't default to expertise. Instead we test every assumption with logic, each idea with reasoning, and all conclusions with \"prove it.\" We choose learning over ego so that our product and our people become the best.\\n\\nWe're looking for a Senior Engineer\\n\\nWe are building an AI-driven simulation of the natural world, where both the rules/objectives and 3D assets are computationally-generated. Our tech stack includes CNNs, GANs, deep reinforcement learning networks, autonomous agents, and Blender. We have an exceptional AI Research team but want to bolster it with a creative Senior Software Engineer. You'll be responsible for helping to develop, support, and productize algorithms to reinforce our product goals.\\n\\nWhat you'll be doing at Imbellus:\\n\\nWrite algorithmic and mathematical code to augment the design, analysis and scoring approach for Imbellus assessments.\\nWork with interdisciplinary teams within Imbellus to maximize the variation potential of tasks and preemptively prevent cheating.\\nEngineer, generate, and validate data sets for use in existing assessment tasks.\\nAnalyze data to improve the product using insights from user data and provide evidence for product claims.\\n\\nWhat you'll need to succeed at Imbellus:\\n\\nBachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or related subject matter. Masters Degree a strong plus.\\nSensibility towards design and strong communication skills\\n3+ years working as a software engineer\\n3+ years using Python 2 and 3, and experience working with those in a production environment\\n1+ years experience with the standard numerical computing technical stack (e.g. scipy, numpy, pandas)\\n1+ years working in a cloud-production environment (preferably AWS)\\n\\nNice to have:\\n\\nFamiliarity with machine learning theory\\nExperience working in an interdisciplinary environment\\nStrong applied mathematical skills, with particular emphasis on graph theory/combinatorics and probability/statistics\\nExperience working in the game or assessment industries\\n\\nOur name comes from the Latin word \"Imbellis,\" a breed of Betta fish.
