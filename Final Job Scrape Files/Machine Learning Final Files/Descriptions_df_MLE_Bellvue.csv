ABOUT US

Xnor.ai brings state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to the edge. Xnor's platform allows companies to run complex deep learning algorithms, formerly restricted to the cloud, locally on a range of devices including mobile phones, drones, and wearables. This new, highly scalable approach ensures complete privacy of data, eliminates the need for connectivity, and significantly reduces memory load and power demands, all without compromising accuracy or performance. Xnor is a venture-funded startup, founded on award-winning research conducted at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Xnor's industry-leading technology is used by global corporations in aerospace, automotive, retail, photography, and consumer electronics.

THE TEAM

As a team, we are working to define and solve the hardest problems in computer vision and AI. Our roots are in research, which means at our core we value learning, intellectual curiosity, and self-starters. When we founded XNOR, we were bold enough to say we can build a better solution for edge devices than relying on cloud computing. As the company scales, we are actively solving some of the world's largest global corporations' most important problems that can only be tackled by bringing intelligence to devices. This means our work needs to be, not only innovative and precise, but also fast, highly reliable, and seamless across a variety of platforms.

THE ROLE
