Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company tackling the challenges of urban growth. Our vision for cities is rooted in a cross-disciplinary approach that is reflected in our team, composed of experts from real estate, government, finance, technology, engineering and more. Since its founding in 2015, Sidewalk Labs has evolved into an organization of over 100 employees based primarily in New York and Toronto.

We are currently designing a new kind of mixed-use, complete community on Toronto's waterfront in partnership with the tripartite agency Waterfront Toronto and the local community. This joint effort, called Sidewalk Toronto, will combine forward-thinking urban design and new digital technology to create a people-centered neighborhood that achieves precedent-setting levels of sustainability, affordability, mobility, and economic opportunity.

We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it.

What is the role?

To improve sustainability in cities, Sidewalk Labs is developing new technology that will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to the status quo, empower smarter management of resources, and reduce the cost of future upgrades and maintenance. We plan for a 75%-85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to similar projects, aiming for Climate Positive.

To achieve our sustainability goals in Quayside, we plan to pilot and scale different kinds of innovation to tackle the thorniest problems in building environment performance. Success requires bold innovation around electricity and thermal systems.

We are looking for a machine learning engineer to join our team in our New York City office. In your first project you will build models and programs that reduce energy use in buildings and cut greenhouse gas emissions through analysis of building management system (BMS) data and other similar systems.

It's a bonus (but not a requirement) if you are familiar with building systems and IoT sensors, their data, and analysis of it (e.g., HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting, etc.).

What is required is passion for sustainability and the desire to create a climate positive community.

What you have you achieve:
Within your first 6 months, you will:

Build from scratch our initial models for studying and reducing energy usage.
Model energy use and reductions, including creating regression-based energy baselines.
Build and refine recommendation engines and predictive models (e.g. time to reach set point, monthly energy consumption).
Create dashboards and interactive visualizations to share ongoing data.
Design communication models catered to cohorts.
Design and build data pipelines and processes for optimal and secure processing of complex data sets.
Develop methods and naming schemas to unify (messy) data from building systems, sensors, APIs, and other sources, enabling a streamlined way to analyze data and prototype use cases.
Build in security and privacy by design.

What we expect:

Know your computer science.
Have a CS background to choose the right algorithms, systems approaches and patterns to solve problems without reinventing the wheel.
Candidates must be able to hit the ground running. Therefore, we generally look for 3+ years of industry experience in a world-class engineering organization.
Experience with Python and at least one systems programming language (C++, Java, or Go). Experience with Google Cloud Platform and/or Kubernetes a plus
Have in-depth experience delivering algorithms and implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines.
Be a technologist.
Bias towards action and shipping. Once you've sketched out an idea, you find the fastest path to a prototype to prove the concept.
You are obsessed with privacy and constantly ask how we can build privacy into product design.
Be comfortable with a range of languages and open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.
Solve problems, together.
Come up with novel solutions, working well with technologists and non-technologists alike.
Ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
Have flexibility to work on the team's most pressing problems.
Passionate about cities.
You have thought about the urban environment and care deeply about improving the lives of urban citizens.

We are very excited to hear from you.

The community of the future is a place for everyone, and Sidewalk Labs is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply. All employment is based on merit and business need."
