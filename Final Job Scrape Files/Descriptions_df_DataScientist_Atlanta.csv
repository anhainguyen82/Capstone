As a Data Scientist at IBM, you will help transform our clients’ data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it’s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.

Your Role and Responsibilities
Data Scientist converts business problems into an analytics solution using their consulting skills, business knowledge to analyze client business issues, formulate hypotheses and test conclusions to determine appropriate solutions methods. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure. This particular role requires deep knowledge and extensive exerience in Incentives Design, Operation, Data models and Statistical Analysis.
