       "      <td>Proofpoint Security Awareness Training, formally Wombat Security is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing development team in at our office located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh.\\nIf you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in a great environment with great people, this is your chance! We’re a security software-as-a-service company so you’ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.\\n\\nQ: Ok. Who are you?\\nA: We’re comprised of some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lot of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.\\n\\nQ: What would I be working on?\\nA: You know all those data breaches you hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You’ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help. Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.\\n\\nQ: Can you tell me a little more about your product?\\nA: Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cyber security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place to do it. You’ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.\\n\\nQ: Where is this position located?\\nA: Pittsburgh, PA where our HQ office is located in the Strip District.\\nQ: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?\\nA: You’ll be working on a key component that has high value and visibility to the organization. It’s a polyglot environment but you’ll do mostly Java, Python, or C# but you’ll also work on our web app using Javascript and Ember.js. You’ll keep in touch with the team using email, Slack, and Google Hangouts.\\nQ: What tools do I have at my disposal?\\nA: Whatever enables you to do your best work with reason (A Tesla won’t help your write code faster, sorry). Everyone on our team uses a Mac.\\n\\nQ: What hours will I work?\\nA: We work typical office hours — but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We’re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.\\n\\nQ: What technology do you use?\\nA: We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, Sidekiq, Redis, Ansible, Git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).\\nResponsibilities\\nPerform development tasks related to delivering java apps, including design, implementation, testing and deployment\\nComfortable with defining/implementing application and system architectures\\nWork with Product Managers and Quality Engineers to ensure the delivery of great, high-quality features\\nInvestigate, prototype and recommend new technologies and solutions\\nExperience &amp; Education Requirements:\\nBS/BA in a software related field or incredible experience that makes us not care about a degree\\n3+ years experience of Java and or Python-5 years experience\\nSkills:\\nYou should possess some solid skills on either front-end or back-end but should have some experience across the board.

Micromanage? Ain’t nobody got time for that!\\nThe ideal candidate will be comfortable leaning in and making it happen. You will be an integral part of the team with a huge impact on the future of our products. We're passionate about what we do and you should be too.\\n\\nThe company offers a competitive base salary and a full benefits package including Medical, Dental and Vision, paid vacation and holidays, 401(k) plan with employer match, life insurance, disability insurance and Free parking.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Proofpoint Security Awareness Training, formally Wombat Security is seeking a Software Engineer – C# to join our growing development team at our Pittsburgh office located in the Strip District. If you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in great environment with great people, this is your chance. We’re a security software-as-a-service company so you’ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.\\n\\nQ: Ok. Who are you?\\nA: We’re comprised of some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lots of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.\\n\\nQ: What would I be working on?\\nA: You know all those data breaches you hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You’ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help. Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.\\n\\nQ: Can you tell me a little more about your product?\\nA: Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess the their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cybersecurity and cutting-edge attacks, this is the where to do it. You’ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.\\n\\nQ: Where is this position located?\\nA: The position is located at our headquarters in Pittsburgh, PA. We are located in the Strip District.\\n\\nQ: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?\\nA: You’ll be working on a key component that has high value and visibility to the organization. It’s a polyglot environment-you might write some C# and then jump into Java, before ending the day working on some Javascript. You’ll keep in touch with the team using Slack, Google Hangouts, and even an ol' IP phone if you’d prefer.\\nQ: What tools do I have at my disposal?\\nA: Whatever enables you to do your best work with reason (A Tesla won’t help your write code faster, sorry). Most of our developers use a Windows or Mac laptop.\\n\\nQ: What hours will I work?\\nA: We work typical office hours — but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We’re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.\\n\\nQ: What technology do you use?\\nA: We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, Sidekiq, Redis, Ansible, Git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).\\nQ: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?\\nA: Here’s a bullet list of what we’re looking for:\\nResponsibilities:\\nPerform development tasks related to delivering (mainly) C# and Java apps, including design, implementation, testing and deployment\\nComfortable with defining/implementing application and system architectures\\nWork with Product Managers and Quality Engineers to ensure the delivery of great, high-quality features\\nInvestigate, prototype, and recommend new technologies and solutions\\nRequirements:\\nBS/BA in a software related field or incredible experience that makes us not care about a degree\\nSkills:\\nAble to work on full-stack\\n3+ years C# (must have), Java, Javascript (nice to have) experience\\nExperience with Office COM model and Office 365 API’s a plus\\nHave good handle of using and creating APIs\\nUnderstand dependency injection (Spring), ORM concepts (Hibernate), MVC\\nDatabase experience\\nComfortable with Git for version control\\nContinuous integration\\nCan work independently and thrives with autonomy\\nThe ideal candidate will be comfortable leaning in and making it happen. You will be an integral part of the team with a huge impact on the future of our products. We're passionate about what we do and you should be too.\\n\\nThe company offers a competitive base salary and a full benefits package including Medical, Dental and Vision, paid vacation and holidays, 401(k) plan with employer match, life insurance, disability insurance and free parking.</td>\n",

       "1    Proofpoint Security Awareness Training, formally Wombat Security is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing development team in at our office located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh.\\nIf you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in a great environment with great people, this is your chance! We’re a security software-as-a-service company so you’ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.\\n\\nQ: Ok. Who are you?\\nA: We’re comprised of some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lot of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.\\n\\nQ: What would I be working on?\\nA: You know all those data breaches you hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You’ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help. Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.\\n\\nQ: Can you tell me a little more about your product?\\nA: Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cyber security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place to do it. You’ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.\\n\\nQ: Where is this position located?\\nA: Pittsburgh, PA where our HQ office is located in the Strip District.\\nQ: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?\\nA: You’ll be working on a key component that has high value and visibility to the organization. It’s a polyglot environment but you’ll do mostly Java, Python, or C# but you’ll also work on our web app using Javascript and Ember.js. You’ll keep in touch with the team using email, Slack, and Google Hangouts.\\nQ: What tools do I have at my disposal?\\nA: Whatever enables you to do your best work with reason (A Tesla won’t help your write code faster, sorry). Everyone on our team uses a Mac.\\n\\nQ: What hours will I work?\\nA: We work typical office hours — but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We’re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.\\n\\nQ: What technology do you use?\\nA: We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, Sidekiq, Redis, Ansible, Git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).\\nResponsibilities\\nPerform development tasks related to delivering java apps, including design, implementation, testing and deployment\\nComfortable with defining/implementing application and system architectures\\nWork with Product Managers and Quality Engineers to ensure the delivery of great, high-quality features\\nInvestigate, prototype and recommend new technologies and solutions\\nExperience & Education Requirements:\\nBS/BA in a software related field or incredible experience that makes us not care about a degree\\n3+ years experience of Java and or Python-5 years experience\\nSkills:\\nYou should possess some solid skills on either front-end or back-end but should have some experience across the board. Most of our developers are interested in being full-stack and Wombat is a great place to get that experience.\\nYou should know Java with Spring and have Python experience. Other pluses include knowing C#, Javascript, Ember.js\\nHave a good handle on using and creating APIs.\\nYou'll do well if you understand dependency injection (Spring), understand how to work with databases and other data stores, understand MVC concepts\\nAll of our developers know their way around SQL\\nComfortable with Git for version control\\nCan work independently and thrives with autonomy. Micromanage? Ain’t nobody got time for that!\\nThe ideal candidate will be comfortable leaning in and making it happen. You will be an integral part of the team with a huge impact on the future of our products. We're passionate about what we do and you should be too.\\n\\nThe company offers a competitive base salary and a full benefits package including Medical, Dental and Vision, paid vacation and holidays, 401(k) plan with employer match, life insurance, disability insurance and Free parking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
