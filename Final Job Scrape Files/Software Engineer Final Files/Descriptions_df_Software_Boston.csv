Blues Wireless is founded on engineering excellence. We know the velocity of the software engineering team has the biggest impact on the bottom line. We believe that high performing software teams satisfy customer requests faster, while doing it more often, recover from failure faster, and fail less. This means we push testing and security to the left to try to find defects as early as possible. We prefer pushing many small changes quickly over having a longer development cycle with larger releases. We leave ourselves clues via metrics, logs, and automated alerts to detect failures and debug them at speed. And we measure everything so we can verify how awesome it all is with confidence.

Our Tech

We currently use Go, Vue.js, and the Hashicorp suite (Packer, Terraform, Consul, Nomad) + Docker. A willingness to learn and experiment with new tech is much more important than hands-on experience with our current stack.

Write clean maintainable code and review your teammates code for the same.
Thoroughly test your own code, from unit tests to automated end-to-end test.
Collect metrics and monitor that everything is working. Also leave a trail of structured logs.
Debug + repair the system if anything is broken
Be deeply concerned with our customers needs and why those needs exist

Who you are:
World class attention to detail and well organized. Was the kid with the neatest lab notebook.
Cares about their teammates and sets them up for success
Was the best on their team at architecture, debugging, writing the most readable code, or all of the above.
Bonus - has experience on the automation side - CI/CD, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Selenium, automating All the Things
Double Bonus - experienced with security. Has been an impact player through a compliance audit (ISOX, SOX)
Triple Word Score - has experience on the ops side - networks + VPN, infrastructure as code, Linux, container orchestration, designing and deploying high availability systems to AWS or another cloud service provider.

Some Of Our Benefits:
Competitive salaries & equity
Heavily subsidized medical, dental, and vision
Unlimited PTO & flexible work schedules
Choice of equipment
Small, cross-functional team
Strong emphasis on collaboration & mentorship

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination.

You will develop large, production-ready applications and build user-facing features that drive our product forward. Join us if you want to make a lasting impact on our organization and industry.

At the core of our platform is a web-based tool for managing factories. Manufacturing engineers use our app builder to create interactive processes, deploy them to the shop floor, and then evaluate the results via our manufacturing analytics engine. None of these are simple problems. They each have their own dilemmas, from visual logic editing to interactive chart builders. We strive to balance complexity and power throughout so that we can delight customers used to dealing with difficult enterprise software.

About us

Do you want to help transform manufacturing? We are building the best team in the industry to bring consumer-grade user experiences to a space dominated by ancient enterprise technology. Our platform enables our customers to create apps without code and to connect their apps to machines, sensors and smart tools. These augmented production lines would otherwise rely on paper to share information. We’re based in Somerville, MA and have raised $31m from NEA, Vertex, and other leading investors. Our customers include some of the largest manufacturers in the world across numerous verticals of the manufacturing industry.

About You

You have experience developing large, production-ready applications. You love building new interfaces that push the product forward and delight users. You’re able to own a core part of the product and juggle the different requirements that come along with it. You love building user-facing features, but you're comfortable moving around the stack to understand how those features work with our backend and infrastructure.

We don't require experience with any specific technologies, but our current frontend is built with React, Redux, and Meteor (Node.js). We store our data in MongoDB and Postgres, and run everything on Kubernetes.

Working at Tulip:
We are building a strong, diverse team that values hard work, families, and personal wellbeing. Benefits of working with us include:


Direct impact on product and culture
Company equity
Competitive benefits package including Health, Dental, Vision, HRA, Commuter, and 401k
Flexible work schedule and unlimited vacation policy
Fully stocked office kitchen with weekly meals and beer on tap
Company outings and happy hours
Fitness subsidies
Dog-friendly office

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

We have a high bar, but also value our teammates as people and the expectations are always reasonable. We have the fun “startup stuff” (craft beer Fridays, ping pong tables, bean bags, and team outings to hike nearby mountains), but more importantly, we invest in people, want to see them grow, and empower them to bring new ideas and innovations to life.

Join a company and be a key part of the Engineering team that provides the hardware, software, and certification platform that brings AI to aviation applications and enables unmanned air vehicles to be used for transportation and other missions.
Autonodyne is a well-funded young company focused on becoming the kernel for unmanned aerial flight. With a world-wide perpetual software license in place with Avidyne that covers $100M in aviation technology IP, expertise in aviation system certification, and a growing customer set, Autonodyne will develop, and if desired by the customer, certify systems and software for civil and defense aircraft that operate without a traditional pilot. While there are many companies providing products and services to the growing UAS market, we already have all of the necessary building blocks and move at higher clock speeds than the competition and are unique in that we are also experts in national and international certification which allows these products to be flown anywhere. Autonodyne is located in Boston, Massachusetts (and has a presence in Concord MA, Burlington MA, Dayton OH, Colorado Springs CO, and greater Los Angeles CA) and is looking for software engineers who are passionate about artificial intelligence algorithms and the UAS/UAV/Unmanned space. This position reports to the Vice President, Engineering.
This is a paid internship position. Timing of the internship is flexible – it may run during the summer months or academic year, or both.
Position Summary:
As a Software Engineering Intern or Designer Intern specializing in user interface, you will be assist in designing and implementing various advanced graphical techniques and presentations of information to be hosted in airborne vehicle mission computers and control stations. These systems are designed for UAS/UAV/Unmanned aviation applications ranging from small, single-person vertical takeoff and land (VTOL) aircraft to multi-passenger air vehicles of varying design to high speed military drones. The job will entail integrating the pilot/controller user interface with the vehicle autonomy and AI in aviation applications. The emerging Urban Air Mobility class of aircraft is a focal point as well as many defense-related projects. You should also expect to interact directly with customers and assist in business development efforts.
The Autonodyne products are currently a mix of existing product sets and many that are under development or haven’t started yet. We place a strong emphasis on graphical user interfaces (GUI) and natural user interfaces (NUI) and are seeking to integrate some forms of naturalistic interfaces like speech and gesture recognition with augmented reality devices to create a next-generation of control stations and on-board control panels.
Single operator control and management of n >> 1 vehicles (e.g. swarming) is an important part of the job. Simplified Vehicle Operations (SVO) for more traditionally manned aviation will also require new ways to present aviation and vehicle state relevant information.
These user interfaces can be on the airborne vehicles themselves, on fixed location ground stations, or on mobile device control stations.
We will be a focused team of engineers primarily based in the Boston area working on a number of rapid-paced, high-energy programs. In short, you will be at the center of making the products a reality.

We’re on a mission to change healthcare — how it’s paid for, delivered, experienced. We want to put people center stage, not process or profit. We are guided by a deep belief that every person on Medicare should be treated like we would treat a member of our own family: with loving care and a profound commitment to their health and well-being.

That’s why we’re gathering a whole bunch of smart, big-hearted people to create a new kind of healthcare company — one that combines compassion, health insurance, clinical care, and technology seamlessly.

A bit about this role:

Technology does amazing things in our daily lives, yet often is a source of pain and confusion within health care. We are delivering a world-class member experience with simple, flexible technical systems. If we need to delve into the murky underbelly of health care IT to do that, we’re up for the challenge.

Our Integrations Engineering team is looking for an engineer to help support the development of a common framework, migrating existing integrations to the new framework, maintenance, and debugging ongoing integrations. The position would primarily be creating integrations per specifications from workstreams (such as provider services, member services, claims, etc.) and in coordination with the Integrations Operations (IO) team.

Our north star is not a specific technology, but rather the goal of continually increasing the leverage of every member of the team. We’re currently building with Go, PostgreSQL, gRPC, GraphQL, React, TypeScript, Terraform, and AWS.

We want to throw the long ball with people we love for a cause we believe in. Life is short. Join us.

Excellent oral and written communication skills (The position will work closely with small project teams of 2-4 researchers. Interfacing with project collaborators in-person and on-line is a key aspect of this position.)
Lab Overview
The Getz Lab has established itself as a world leader in the development and application of computational tools for the analysis cancer genomes. The lab specializes in cancer genome analyses which include: (i) Characterizing the cancer Genome, (ii) Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways, and (iii) Characterizing the heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer.
Characterizing the cancer genome
Cancer is a disease of the genome that is driven by a combination of possible germline risk-alleles together with a set of “driver” somatic mutations that are acquired during the clonal expansion of increasingly fitter clones. In order to generate a comprehensive list of all germline and somatic events that occurred during life and the development of the cancer, the lab develops and applies highly sensitive and specific tools for detecting different types of mutations in massively-parallel sequencing data. The volume, noise and complexity of these data require developing computational tools using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches to extract the signal from the noise.
Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways
Next, the detected oncogenic events across a cohort of samples are analyzed, searching for genes/ pathways, as well as non-coding variants, that show significant signals of positive selection. To that end, we construct a statistical model of the background mutational processes and then detect genes that deviate from it. As part of constructing the models, we study and infer the mutational processes that affected the samples (carcinogens, defects in repair mechanisms, etc.) and their timing.
We have developed tools for detecting significantly gained or lost genes in cancer and genes with increased density or irregular patterns of mutations. Our work demonstrated the importance of modeling the heterogeneity of these models across patients, sequence contexts and the genome, when searching for cancer genes.
Heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer
Cancer samples are heterogeneous, containing a mixture of normal cells and cancer cells that often represent multiple subclones. We developed and continue to develop tools for characterizing the heterogeneity of cancer samples using copy-number and mutation data measured on bulk samples and now also analyzing the genomic material in individual cells. Using these tools, we can infer which mutations are clonal or sub-clonal, as well as estimate the number of subclones and their distribution over space and time. Correlating these analyses with clinical data, we can gain insite into the development of resistance during the course of treatment. We are now working to introduce these concepts to clinical trials and eventually clinical care.
Collaborative Science
Members of the Getz Lab work closely with clinical researchers and in large collaborative projects sponsored by NIH (e.g., TCGA) and charitable initiatives (e.g, Stand Up to Cancer, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative) and industry partners. These collaborative efforts are significantly enhanced by the creation of data portals for the sharing of experimental data, analysis results and tools.
