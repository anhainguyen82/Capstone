       "      <td>New Relic\\nPortland, Oregon (or Remote)\\nYour Opportunity\\nThe Ruby Agent team is looking for a senior software engineer to help us build lightweight, dependable data collection software that our customers trust enough to put into their production applications.\\nWe’re a small, close-knit team. We work together and are always learning.\\nWe are excited to consider a remote engineer for this role in the Pacific Standard Time zone. If you are not in the PST zone, you must be willing to work within our normal office hours. Remote team members will be expected to work out of their home office and must have successfully worked remotely before.\\nWhat's Interesting About This Job\\nOur code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications. While we have no control over the hosts and environments our agent runs in, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.\\nOur agent needs to slip into these varied environments, into an application, and figure out where the interesting bits are. There it sits, tiny and silent, gathering timings and other data to give our customers visibility into the real performance of their apps.\\nWe write code for the wild, and it is not easy. But we have been doing this for years, and would love to share what we’ve discovered. Ideally, you have things to teach us, too.\\nWhat You'll Do\\nYou will help us build and maintain the Ruby Agent and other data collection software for the Ruby community.\\nYou will write tests. With our comprehensive test suite, we make sure everything we ship is well tested. We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure each release is thoroughly tested and dependable.\\nYou will support our agent, assisting our Technical Support Engineers. We take support rotations where we help customers solve issues and get the most of the agent. We come away from these rotations with ideas of how we can improve our agent to serve our customers better.\\nWhile our team charter is well-defined and fairly narrow, we still have quite a diversity of tasks.\\nTeam Traits\\nAccountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.\\nAttention to detail: We do excellent work every time, and help each other strive for this excellence.\\nRuby expertise: We write Ruby code that metaprograms our customers' Ruby code, and which has to run on multiple versions of Ruby and JRuby.\\nTeamwork: We work closely together and believe in the power of pairing. It’s a great way of sharing information and ensuring quality. And it’s more fun!\\nStrong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.\\n“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.\\nYour Qualifications\\nMust-have:\\nExperience writing efficient Ruby. Customers run our code in their production systems. In order to keep our footprint light, we are on the lookout for unnecessary object allocations and overly complex code.\\nExperience reading through source code for popular libraries, find out how they work, and find the best places to hook our instrumentation code into them.\\nExperience writing comprehensive tests.\\nNot Sure If This Is You?\\nWe are particularly interested in having a diverse team, with a broad set of skills and viewpoints. If this seems like your dream job, but you're not sure if you qualify, apply anyway! We'll carefully consider every applicant that takes the time to apply for this specific position. We'll either move forward with you, find other teams that might be a better match, keep in touch for later opportunities, or thank you for your time.\\nWhen you apply, be sure to include a cover letter telling us what interests you about this position and why you think it would be a good fit for you. Cover letters matter to us — we really read them.\\nA Little About New Relic\\nWe offer:\\nLarge organizational scale (60+ engaged and productive engineering teams)\\nLarge technical scale (several billion events ingested per minute)\\nEmployee resource groups to support a diverse workforce\\n17,000+ passionate and paying customers\\n10 weeks of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement\\nWork on a product that all your technical friends use\\nPlease note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.\\nOur Office\\nOur office is in the center of downtown Portland, situated in a thriving tech community in the Pacific Northwest. We enjoy easy commute access and a plethora of good eats and great coffee. We provide competitive compensation including equity and big-company benefits (medical, dental, etc.)—all while maintaining the energy, agility and fun of a start-up.\\nAbout Us\\nNew Relic (NYSE: NEWR) is the industry’s largest and most comprehensive cloud-based instrumentation platform built to create more perfect software.

We understand that our customers look to us for guidance through the increasingly treacherous threat landscape, often entrusting us with their vital assets: their data. Being a “hero” means that you are driven by a cause greater than yourself, driven to fight for what is right and just for the benefit of others. To answer this call, Armor Heroes must be morally right, virtuous servants. A vigorously trained, committed group devoted to protection and defense. Their unrelenting desire to destroy attackers and eliminate threats is innate. Their ultimate reward is the fulfillment in knowing that people have been protected.\\n\\nRelentless Security : We are a security company. It’s our top priority. It is why we exist. We never compromise in our effort to defend sensitive data and provide customers with the industry’s most secure environments. We volunteer our best every day and go to any length to ensure our customers are protected to the fullest extent possible. We do not believe in taking shortcuts to deliver services or protect our customers. Simply put, we want customers to rave about their experience with us.\\n\\nEmbrace Change : When frequent and unexpected change becomes the only constant, Armor Heroes must be able to adapt quickly while remaining focused on delivering exceptional results for our customers. In the modern IT landscape, we don’t have the luxury of becoming set in our ways, especially when the threat landscape continues to evolve at a blistering pace. Being complacent not only puts our customers at risk but also the legacy we have built as champions for data security in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats. We are ardent believers in embracing change and leveraging it for the betterment of those we serve.\\n\\nBad News First : We know that from time to time situations occur that are out of our control. We also acknowledge that no company or individual is perfect. We foster a culture that encourages a healthy degree of calculated risk-taking, which we believe drives creativity and innovation. While we strive for perfection, we encourage Heroes to bring issues to the table and recommend solutions. This corporate culture allows us to grow as a company, determine areas where we can improve, and work in an environment of honesty and openness.\\n\\nTenacious Execution : When it comes to the security we provide our customers, good-enough service is simply not good enough. Armor believes in going beyond the expectations of our customers and providing them with a level of service that leaves them with a raving impression of our company and employees. We apply this same pursuit to our Heroes. We want our Heroes to rave about working at Armor. Their enthusiasm and passion will produce a higher quality of service that translates to a better customer experience. We understand the importance of this connection. Ultimately, our goal is to make every customer a Raving Fan.\\n\\nCheck your Ego : We recognize that every employee brings experience and a unique skill set to the company. We value our diversity. No one individual is more important than another and that every contribution has significance in its own way. This is why our heroes check their ego at the door each day. This cultural mindset helps ensure that we work together effectively, as a team, to deliver the best security and service to our customers.\\nBack Share\\nApply Now</td>\n",

       "4    New Relic\\nPortland, Oregon (or Remote)\\nYour Opportunity\\nThe Ruby Agent team is looking for a senior software engineer to help us build lightweight, dependable data collection software that our customers trust enough to put into their production applications.\\nWe’re a small, close-knit team. We work together and are always learning.\\nWe are excited to consider a remote engineer for this role in the Pacific Standard Time zone. If you are not in the PST zone, you must be willing to work within our normal office hours. Remote team members will be expected to work out of their home office and must have successfully worked remotely before.\\nWhat's Interesting About This Job\\nOur code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications. While we have no control over the hosts and environments our agent runs in, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.\\nOur agent needs to slip into these varied environments, into an application, and figure out where the interesting bits are. There it sits, tiny and silent, gathering timings and other data to give our customers visibility into the real performance of their apps.\\nWe write code for the wild, and it is not easy. But we have been doing this for years, and would love to share what we’ve discovered. Ideally, you have things to teach us, too.\\nWhat You'll Do\\nYou will help us build and maintain the Ruby Agent and other data collection software for the Ruby community.\\nYou will write tests. With our comprehensive test suite, we make sure everything we ship is well tested. We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure each release is thoroughly tested and dependable.\\nYou will support our agent, assisting our Technical Support Engineers. We take support rotations where we help customers solve issues and get the most of the agent. We come away from these rotations with ideas of how we can improve our agent to serve our customers better.\\nWhile our team charter is well-defined and fairly narrow, we still have quite a diversity of tasks.\\nTeam Traits\\nAccountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.\\nAttention to detail: We do excellent work every time, and help each other strive for this excellence.\\nRuby expertise: We write Ruby code that metaprograms our customers' Ruby code, and which has to run on multiple versions of Ruby and JRuby.\\nTeamwork: We work closely together and believe in the power of pairing. It’s a great way of sharing information and ensuring quality. And it’s more fun!\\nStrong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.\\n“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.\\nYour Qualifications\\nMust-have:\\nExperience writing efficient Ruby. Customers run our code in their production systems. In order to keep our footprint light, we are on the lookout for unnecessary object allocations and overly complex code.\\nExperience reading through source code for popular libraries, find out how they work, and find the best places to hook our instrumentation code into them.\\nExperience writing comprehensive tests.\\nNot Sure If This Is You?\\nWe are particularly interested in having a diverse team, with a broad set of skills and viewpoints. If this seems like your dream job, but you're not sure if you qualify, apply anyway! We'll carefully consider every applicant that takes the time to apply for this specific position. We'll either move forward with you, find other teams that might be a better match, keep in touch for later opportunities, or thank you for your time.\\nWhen you apply, be sure to include a cover letter telling us what interests you about this position and why you think it would be a good fit for you. Cover letters matter to us — we really read them.\\nA Little About New Relic\\nWe offer:\\nLarge organizational scale (60+ engaged and productive engineering teams)\\nLarge technical scale (several billion events ingested per minute)\\nEmployee resource groups to support a diverse workforce\\n17,000+ passionate and paying customers\\n10 weeks of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement\\nWork on a product that all your technical friends use\\nPlease note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.\\nOur Office\\nOur office is in the center of downtown Portland, situated in a thriving tech community in the Pacific Northwest. We enjoy easy commute access and a plethora of good eats and great coffee. We provide competitive compensation including equity and big-company benefits (medical, dental, etc.)—all while maintaining the energy, agility and fun of a start-up.\\nAbout Us\\nNew Relic (NYSE: NEWR) is the industry’s largest and most comprehensive cloud-based instrumentation platform built to create more perfect software.
