Our job at A3 is very simple: we seek to disrupt Airbus (and the competition) before anyone else can. And in the process, we are setting out to build the future of flight.\\n\\nAt A³, we execute projects and foster partnerships. Projects are ambitious, risky, time-constrained undertakings that culminate in a demonstration at convincing scale—something that's more than a mere prototype, but somewhat short of a product. One project is focused on advanced digital design and manufacturing processes and tools.\\n\\nYour role as a Software Engineer will be to assist the Engineering Leads in executing a work package for an A³ project with a focus on speed, quality, and cost. You will need to understand the analytic framework and business case the project is based on and advocate it within groups internal to and external to the project. You will need to be comfortable using supplied data to make informed decisions regarding implementation of software use cases and be comfortable working in an agile work environment, where quick delivery, constant testing, and iteration are the norm. As our projects are \"out-of-the-box\" by design, you will be expected to seek, investigate, and implement creative solutions to challenges and obstacles that emerge. You will use your knowledge and talent as a Software Engineer to implement the software to demonstrate the project's analytic framework.\\n\\nTo get specific, your responsibilities will include:\\n\\nDevelop, document and maintain architectures, requirements, algorithms, interfaces and designs for software systems.\\nDevelop tools and processes to demonstrate the program analytic framework\\nContribute from a security and software engineering perspective during design of software systems\\nDevelopment of code and integration of complex software components into a fully functional system\\nCreation of software verification plans, test procedures, and test environments, executing test procedures, and documenting the results to ensure software requirements are met\\nParticipation in code and architecture reviews as required\\nDevelopment of documentation for software written\\nAggressively pursue program-specific tasks and issues identified by the Engineering Leads, Project Executive\\n\\nWe expect that you will have:\\n\\nAn undergraduate degree in a technical field and at least 3 years of progressively ambitious work experience and a demonstrated track record in Software Engineering and Testing.\\nStrong Java or Python development experience\\nStrong knowledge of web services (JAX, REST) and transfer protocols (HTTP, FTP, SOAP)\\nExperience in creation of web-accessible Application Programming Interfaces\\nExperience in creating web services from monolithic applications.\\nExperience with database design and implementation, more specifically with PostgreSQL\\nExcellent communication, presenting issues and ideas in a simplified form focusing on importance\\n\\nIn addition, the following skills and qualifications will be an advantage:\\n\\n\\nExperience in Manufacturing Process Modeling\\nSoftware development experience in a production environment\\nPassion for increasing the productivity of engineering teams\\nAbility to work under pressure to meet sometimes aggressive deadlines\\n\\nTo succeed in this position, you need to be willing to work with a flexible schedule including travel.\\n\\nBy the way, you might be interested to know that we offer a killer benefits package as well as a flight training benefit, just in case you don't already have your pilot's license!\\n\\nA³ by Airbus is an equal opportunity employer in every category. The data is incontrovertible that diversity leads to better teams, better performance, and better results. Consequently, we actively seek candidates of all genders, backgrounds, and experiences.</td>\n",

It’s time to capitalize on the success stories and proven track record around the globe, and it’s time to scale. It’s time to bring our innovative, affordable, open-source solutions to a market facing an ever-growing threat of cyberattacks.\\n\\nThis means a unique opportunity for people joining the StrongKey team. We can offer the autonomy, excitement, strategy-setting, navigating ambiguity, and challenge of a startup. And yet, all of that is backed up with 18 years of proven security, thought leadership, and a working business model. If you are tired of being lost in the crowd or feeling like you don’t have the opportunity for personal impact, we think we could be a compelling place for you to work. And if you drool at the opportunity to collaboratively create something new, we want you on board.\\n\\nWhat You’ll Do Here\\n\\nWe are looking for a qualified Software Engineer to work with our Software Development and Support teams.

As you learn how we solve problems and become more familiar with our products, we have several potential growth paths. You may find yourself in a more senior engineering position or a team lead. Or, you could work your way toward specialization (e.g., UX, web development, QA testing). Lastly, if you gravitate toward working with people, you could work your way toward an engineering sales role. Whatever your goals, we are committed to supporting your growth. And we believe we are a company who will grow alongside you, creating new and meaningful opportunities into the future.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nComputer Science degree (Master’s a bonus) or comparable field of study.\\nCourses, studies, knowledge or experience with Cryptography and Computer Security, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Advanced Computer Architecture, Database Systems Principles, and Server Web Programming.\\nProficient with Java, webservices, Linux, and RDBMS.\\nFamiliarity with open source technology.\\n(Nice to have, but not required) – knowledge of Fast Identity Online (FIDO), web application frameworks, cloud technology, and mobile development.\\nWe can offer the autonomy, excitement, strategy-setting, navigating ambiguity, and challenge of a startup, yet all of that is backed up with 18 years of proven security, thought leadership, and a working business model. If you are tired of being lost in the crowd or feeling like you don’t have the opportunity for personal impact, we think we could be a compelling place for you to work. And if you drool at the opportunity to collaboratively create something new, we want you on board.\\n\\nThe Kind of Person Who Would Enjoy Working Here\\n\\nKnows how to communicate well in all circumstances, whether requiring directness, empathy, feedback, listening, or all of the above. We value the “human” in human capital a lot more than the capital, and we’re looking for people who feel the same way.\\nCan understand equally the challenges and limitations of engineering, while also thinking through how an everyday, non-technical person may interact with our product. Understands how to empathetically envision a day in the life of a customer.\\nIs equally comfortable chatting with a non-technical customer, as you are in a highly technical conversation with other engineers.\\nIs energetic, optimistic, creative, curious, flexible (we’re a startup!), people-oriented, comfortable leading, bold yet humble, and a passionate problem-solver.\\nHas a love of life beyond work! If you love board games, coffee, fitness, pub trivia, dinner parties, books, disc golf, or any number of other things you’ll be in good company. (And if none of that’s you, well then you’ll just add your stuff to the list!)\\nCompensation, Benefits, and a Bit More about Us\\n\\nStrongKey is based out of Durham, NC and Cupertino, CA. This role is based out of our Cupertino location.\\n\\nAs an early member of the StrongKey team, you will be compensated with a competitive salary, benefits, and equity stake. You will also have the opportunity to help build a company from its early days and work closely with our co-founders. If you’re motivated by helping write a company’s story from the near-beginning, this is a powerful opportunity for you to join the ground floor of a company we truly believe is going to be meaningful.\\n\\nHow to Apply\\n\\nPlease send your resume and a short cover letter (no longer than a page) to jobs@strongkey.com.

       "0    A³ by Airbus is the Silicon Valley outpost of Airbus. The mission of Airbus is to make things fly. Our job at A3 is very simple: we seek to disrupt Airbus (and the competition) before anyone else can. And in the process, we are setting out to build the future of flight.\\n\\nAt A³, we execute projects and foster partnerships. Projects are ambitious, risky, time-constrained undertakings that culminate in a demonstration at convincing scale—something that's more than a mere prototype, but somewhat short of a product. One project is focused on advanced digital design and manufacturing processes and tools.\\n\\nYour role as a Software Engineer will be to assist the Engineering Leads in executing a work package for an A³ project with a focus on speed, quality, and cost. You will need to understand the analytic framework and business case the project is based on and advocate it within groups internal to and external to the project. You will need to be comfortable using supplied data to make informed decisions regarding implementation of software use cases and be comfortable working in an agile work environment, where quick delivery, constant testing, and iteration are the norm. As our projects are \"out-of-the-box\" by design, you will be expected to seek, investigate, and implement creative solutions to challenges and obstacles that emerge. You will use your knowledge and talent as a Software Engineer to implement the software to demonstrate the project's analytic framework.\\n\\nTo get specific, your responsibilities will include:\\n\\nDevelop, document and maintain architectures, requirements, algorithms, interfaces and designs for software systems.\\nDevelop tools and processes to demonstrate the program analytic framework\\nContribute from a security and software engineering perspective during design of software systems\\nDevelopment of code and integration of complex software components into a fully functional system\\nCreation of software verification plans, test procedures, and test environments, executing test procedures, and documenting the results to ensure software requirements are met\\nParticipation in code and architecture reviews as required\\nDevelopment of documentation for software written\\nAggressively pursue program-specific tasks and issues identified by the Engineering Leads, Project Executive\\n\\nWe expect that you will have:\\n\\nAn undergraduate degree in a technical field and at least 3 years of progressively ambitious work experience and a demonstrated track record in Software Engineering and Testing.\\nStrong Java or Python development experience\\nStrong knowledge of web services (JAX, REST) and transfer protocols (HTTP, FTP, SOAP)\\nExperience in creation of web-accessible Application Programming Interfaces\\nExperience in creating web services from monolithic applications.\\nExperience with database design and implementation, more specifically with PostgreSQL\\nExcellent communication, presenting issues and ideas in a simplified form focusing on importance\\n\\nIn addition, the following skills and qualifications will be an advantage:\\n\\n\\nExperience in Manufacturing Process Modeling\\nSoftware development experience in a production environment\\nPassion for increasing the productivity of engineering teams\\nAbility to work under pressure to meet sometimes aggressive deadlines\\n\\nTo succeed in this position, you need to be willing to work with a flexible schedule including travel.\\n\\nBy the way, you might be interested to know that we offer a killer benefits package as well as a flight training benefit, just in case you don't already have your pilot's license!\\n\\nA³ by Airbus is an equal opportunity employer in every category. The data is incontrovertible that diversity leads to better teams, better performance, and better results. Consequently, we actively seek candidates of all genders, backgrounds, and experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "254  About StrongKey\\n\\nStrongKey is making data breaches irrelevant. We are redefining the way businesses and government agencies secure their information against the inevitability of a breach through providing four specific practices that ensures their data, no matter the format, remains encrypted and protected at the highest possible level. While other security solutions focus on predicting, containing, or looking after the perimeter, StrongKey provides strong authentication, encryption, and digital signatures – underpinned by key management – to ensure data security, even with an attacker on your network. We’re trusted by some of the largest companies and critical government agencies around the globe, and we have tailored solutions whether you’re a multinational corporation, small business, or just you – working from your home office.\\n\\nFounded in 2001, we are now at a pivotal time to grow. It’s time to capitalize on the success stories and proven track record around the globe, and it’s time to scale. It’s time to bring our innovative, affordable, open-source solutions to a market facing an ever-growing threat of cyberattacks.\\n\\nThis means a unique opportunity for people joining the StrongKey team. We can offer the autonomy, excitement, strategy-setting, navigating ambiguity, and challenge of a startup. And yet, all of that is backed up with 18 years of proven security, thought leadership, and a working business model.
