The workplace of the future will be powered by AI and the Cisco Webex Intelligence team is making that a reality. Two fast-moving startups (MindMeld and Accompany) were recently acquired by Cisco to disrupt and boost the industry's #1 Collaboration portfolio. We aim to build the next generation of collaboration software & devices - from digitizing the in-meeting experience, enhancing distributed team efficiency and improving all aspects of people connection.
In this role, you'll work on our People Insights features. People Insights provides our customers with perfect context on the people they are meeting and collaborating with, right when they need it. We render rich profiles on the people you're meeting with right inside Webex, so that you have the context you need right at your fingertips... Who are you meeting with? What are the most important facts about the company they work for? Do you have anything in common with them?
People Insights helps customers answer all these questions and more, and we do it by curating the world's largest database of senior decision makers in the world. We are building a proprietary data platform that scours billions of pages on the web and uses intelligence and machine learning to create the richest, most real-time profiles in the world for hundreds of millions of people and tens of millions of companies.
How do you decide which parts of the web to crawl? How do you extract structured data from unstructured text? How do you efficiently keep this data up to date? With this people and company data, we're building services that can operate at scale to deliver personalized data and competitive insights. How do you store and query all this data efficiently? What unique deductions and insights might you make from it?
And to display this personalized data and these competitive insights, we're building fast, powerful features across Cisco's entire portfolio of collaboration apps that are a delight for our customers to use. How do you show so much data while still keeping a UI simple and easy to use? How do you build powerful functionality while staying extremely performant?
People Insights is ripe with exciting technical challenges, most of which have yet to be solved here and some of which have yet to be solved anywhere!

Who You’ll Work With
We have a small but mighty team of engineers who are exceptionally talented and all low ego. Many of our engineers have founded their own startups prior to forming Webex Intelligence, in domains ranging from crowdfunding to dynamic pricing to real-time document editing. Others have built significant infrastructure at larger companies like Google and Amazon. We draw on this well of experiences every day as we collaborate on our own product, tech stack, and go to market strategy. We're all highly collaborative, committed to building great things, and consider it a privilege to learn from each other every day.

Who You Are
You take pride in building and shipping fabulous software. You thrive on ownership and autonomy, but are also committed tocollaborating and communicating across the team's different stakeholders and domain experts. You enjoy working in an interdisciplinary environment that requires interfacing cross-functionally, from product to sales to customer support. You hold yourself and your teammates to a very high degree of quality in everything you do. You're hungry to apply the skills you already have, and to learn new ones from the work you'll do and team you'll work with. You thrive on constructive feedback and you deliver results that matter.
Requirements
Experience writing robust systems that have served real customers
Solid foundation in Computer Science (algorithms, data structures, software design)
Great can-do attitude and ability to thrive and learn in a fast-paced environment
Strong written and verbal communication abilities and a commitment to using them
Desire to work on a highly scalable and available system used by tens of millions of users daily
Most of our codebase is in Ruby and C++, but languages can be learned. We prioritize general programming ability over any specific language experience.
Experience being a generalist—curiosity about and ability to work on different parts of the system (backend, front-end, mobile, data mining, machine learning)

Why Cisco
At Cisco, each person brings their unique talents to work as a team and make a difference. Yes, our technology changes the way the world works, lives, plays and learns, but our edge comes from our people.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.

What We Are About:
------------------

Our guiding philosophy in Engineering is to get things right through practicing disciplined engineering, focusing, not cutting corners, and of course having fun while we are at it. We believe in enabling ownership at all levels of the organization and empowering teams. If you thrive in this culture, come join us, we are changing how enterprises secure their applications.

-------------------------

What You Will Accomplish:
-------------------------


We are looking for help in a core team building our Policy Compute Engine, the central brain of Illumio's system. We are a small, flat group. We embolden and listen to each engineer, not just the good orators or strong voices. We seek help with the design of critical features and subsystems and need someone who can not only come with the ideas but can also think things through; work out the details and defend the design before their peers.
You will be writing lock-free concurrent code for a distributed system that works inside the datacenter and across geographic boundaries.
Our system is part of mission critical infrastructure for investment banks, SaaS providers, and large enterprise customers.
We seek someone with strong engineering fundamentals, who understands the trade-offs between complexity and reliability, employing a variety of concepts ranging from connection pipelining to reliable broadcast protocol design.
Most of our code is written in Ruby, which we chose mainly for the high productivity (we don't use much of Rails framework, though). Instead of thread pools so widely used in JVM/CLR, we utilize process forking and evented code (similar to NodeJS and Twisted) to scale.
Writing Ruby extensions in C is very easy and encouraged. The variety of open source technologies we utilize to support our app include Redis, used as NoSQL data store and also for set arithmetic and graph computation. PostgreSQL is our reliable, transactional relational database. We use ActiveRecord Object/Relational mapper to access our relational data, similar to Hibernate, Django etc.
The other tools include NGINX, Memcached etc.
Last but not least we are a start-up with tight deadlines, and a dynamic environment. Our guiding philosophy from the beginning is focus, get things right, and practice disciplined engineering that does not cut corners.

--------------------

What You Will Bring:
--------------------


BS in Computer Science 2021 or MSCS 2021 or related engineering discipline
Some industry experience building and delivering high-performance, scalable, distributed systems
Some understanding of the use of SQL databases in building highly-available enterprise applications. Understanding of NoSQL options.
Excellent coding skills in Java, Python and the desire to learn Ruby.
Any Linux experience

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You will take on challenging, novel situations every day, and work with just about every other engineering and operations team to provide services and applications that are quintessentially Google — fast, reliable and accessible to all.
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world.

The consumer organization at PayPal focuses on new products and capabilities offered to the consumer segment of PayPal users. This organization is responsible for all the experiences and services offered to buyers and casual sellers. Some of the areas of focus are P2P payments, Incentives, login dashboard, shopping experience and consumer utilities like contact book and device management.
One of the core branches of the consumer organization is CEP, which stands for “Customer Engagement Platform”. This platform’s core KPI is to improve the engagement of PayPal customers with PayPal products and experiences and in the process, increase adoption. There are two critical paths for personalization, Product and Marketing, which translates to the best product experience, personalized for a user at a point in time and the best marketing message personalized for a user. In both the cases, the customer is at the center, to surface the best and the most relevant experiences for them to be pleased with the experience. There are various systems involved, like segmentation platform, personalization platform, channel management etc.; to realize one of these experiences, all these systems work independently to compute massive data and a management platform is used to tie these together.
From an integration standpoint, personalization platform is the central decision engine to choose the most relevant message/experience to be surfaced to the end user. This is decided based on various factors like the segment of the user, different message competing with priority ranking, contextual data, frequency of the message rendered, customer interaction metrics etc. This requires the platform to be built with scalable, performant and robust infrastructure to be able to make this decision in few 10 ms. The platform receives ~100 million requests per day which further adds to the complexity in the way the platform needs to be coded.

You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.
