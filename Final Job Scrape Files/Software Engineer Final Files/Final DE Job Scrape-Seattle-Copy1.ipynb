We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.\\nSoftware Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them.

You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.\\nSome of the things our Software Engineers have done:\\nBuilt a web-based mapping interface that handles millions of data points dynamically displayed at once.\\nConstructed an analysis platform on top of a columnar database and custom infrastructure that allows complex numerical analysis at the petabyte scale.\\nBuilt AtlasDB, which provides high-scale, reliable data storage for Palantir products. This NoSQL distributed data store adds a transactional layer that gives the whole system ACID properties.\\nDeveloped a WYSIWYG web app for quickly creating interactive, data-driven web sites.\\nWorked on a variety of Palantir open-source projects.
