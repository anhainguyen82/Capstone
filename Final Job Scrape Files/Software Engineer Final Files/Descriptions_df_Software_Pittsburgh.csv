BS/BA in a software related field or incredible experience that makes us not care about a degree
3+ years experience of Java and or Python-5 years experience","Proofpoint Security Awareness Training, formally Wombat Security is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing development team in at our office located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh.
If you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in a great environment with great people, this is your chance! We’re a security software-as-a-service company so you’ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.

Q: Ok. Who are you?
A: We’re comprised of some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lot of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.

Q: What would I be working on?
A: You know all those data breaches you hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You’ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help. Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.

Q: Can you tell me a little more about your product?
A: Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cyber security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place to do it. You’ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.

Q: Where is this position located?
A: Pittsburgh, PA where our HQ office is located in the Strip District.
Q: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?
A: You’ll be working on a key component that has high value and visibility to the organization. It’s a polyglot environment but you’ll do mostly Java, Python, or C# but you’ll also work on our web app using Javascript and Ember.js. You’ll keep in touch with the team using email, Slack, and Google Hangouts.
Q: What tools do I have at my disposal?
A: Whatever enables you to do your best work with reason (A Tesla won’t help your write code faster, sorry). Everyone on our team uses a Mac.

Q: What hours will I work?
A: We work typical office hours — but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We’re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.

Q: What technology do you use?
A: We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, Sidekiq, Redis, Ansible, Git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).

Argo AI is developing and deploying the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision to help build safe and efficient self-driving vehicles that enable these transformations and more. The challenges are significant, but we are a team that believes in tackling hard, meaningful problems to improve the world.

We are building a high-performance team that is excited by complex engineering challenges and is passionate about making transportation safer, more affordable and accessible for all.

Machine learning, more specifically deep learning algorithms (detection, segmentation, and fusion tasks) are one of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles and a key part of our autonomy stack. Self-driving cars need to perceive objects and actors around the vehicle to make the correct decisions. The implementation must meet rigorous real time constraints and reliably report detections in 2D or 3D spaces. Ultimately, we must not only solve the algorithm challenges but produce safety-quality high performance software. So this position is as much a software challenge as it is a core algorithm challenge.

We are seeking hands on candidates who have a mix of computer vision, machine learning expertise, embedded and real time constraints and low level accelerators (FPGA, GPUs). We are looking for practitioners who will be deep in code, and are technically strong in software and (ideally) strong in applied machine learning algorithms. Candidates need not have worked on self-driving, or robotics applications. Candidates with extremely strong skills in some areas but weaker in others will be considered with a bias towards strong software engineering skills.

What you'll do:

Core models used for scene understanding that are front and center in the perception pipeline
Research projects improving not only our current image space but also radar, Lidar space detection algorithms and best methods to fuse together to improve performance
Turning algorithm exploration that performs best on rigorous and pragmatic A vs B experiments evaluated extensively on data into models/software running on the vehicle
Working with data collection to select and label relevant data to improve our supervised training
Working with label tooling team to adjust labeling policies, and approaches to obtain the best label set needed
Develop production quality code and own your algorithms from design to production.

What we're looking for:

Degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field
Strong Preference for Computer Vision / Machine Learning academic focus
Industry experience with complete end to end hands on experience deploying real products or platforms into complex production environments
Strong software engineering knowledge and deep expertise in C++ and/or python is required
Strong theoretical and applied knowledge of relevant subsets of detection algorithms including Classification, scene understanding, object detection classes of algorithms
Experienced software engineer or research with a track record of real world applications incorporating machine learning and computer vision
Real-time applications experience is a strong plus
Familiarity with Mxnet, caffe, tensorflow or other similar deep net or machine learning packages
GPU expertise
Strong preference for publication history in top vision journals/conferences (CVPR, NIPS, ECCV, ICML)

At Argo AI, we have a strong emphasis on creating a highly effective team environment. Thus, we seek candidates that can work effectively with others across a broad range of disciplines.

","It's fun to work in a company where people truly BELIEVE in what they're doing!
We're committed to bringing passion and customer focus to the business.
Company Overview
At Proofpoint, we have a passion for protecting people, data, and brands from today’s advanced threats and compliance risks. We hire the best people in the business to:
Build and enhance our proven security platform
Blend innovation and speed in a constantly evolving cloud architecture
Analyze new threats and offer deep insight through data-driven intel
Collaborate with customers to help solve their toughest security challenges
We are singularly devoted to helping our customers protect what matters most. That’s why we’re a leader in next-generation cybersecurity—and why more than half of the Fortune 100 trust us as a security partner.
We are seeking a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing development team in Pittsburgh. C# experience is preferred. However, we are open to C++, Java, and Python experience.
If you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, a great environment with great people, this is your chance. We’re a security software-as-a-service company so you’ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.
Q: Ok. Who are you?
A: We’re comprised of some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lot of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.
Q: What would I be working on?
A: You know all those data breaches you hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You’ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help.
Q: Can you tell me a little more about your product?
A: Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Proofpoint is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cybersecurity and cutting-edge attacks, this is where to do it. You’ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.
Q: Where is this position located?
A: Pittsburgh, PA in the Strip District.
Q: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?
A: You’ll be working on key components that have high value and visibility to the organization. It’s a polyglot environment-you might write some C# and then jump into Java, before ending the day working on some Javascript.
Q: What tools do I have at my disposal?
A: Whatever enables you to do your best work with reason (A Tesla won’t help you write code faster, sorry). Most of our developers use a Mac laptop.
Q: What hours will I work?
A: We work typical office hours — but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We’re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.
Q: What technology do you use?
A: We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, Sidekiq, Redis, Ansible, Git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).
Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?
A: Here’s a bullet list of what we’re looking for:
Your day to day
Perform development tasks related to delivering (mainly) C# and Java apps, including design, implementation, testing and deployment
Comfortable with defining/implementing application and system architectures
Work with Product Managers and Quality Engineers to ensure the delivery of great, high-quality features
Investigate, prototype and recommend new technologies and solutions
What you bring to the team
Able to work on full-stack
5 to 7 years experience with C# preferred or C++, Java, Python
Experience with Office COM model and Office 365 API’s a plus

Comfortable with Git for version control
Continuous integration
Can work independently and thrives with autonomy.
Requirements:
BS/BA in a software related field or incredible experience that makes us not care about a degree
The ideal candidate will be comfortable leaning in and making it happen. You will be an integral part of the team with a huge impact on the future of our products. We're passionate about what we do and you should be too.
Why Proofpoint
As a customer focused and driven-to-win organization with leading edge products, there are many exciting reasons to join the Proofpoint team. We believe in hiring the best the brightest and cultivating a culture of collaboration and appreciation.

About the Role

As a robotics infrastructure software engineer, you will build and integrate core software systems running on-board the fleet of self-driving vehicles. Your team is the first line of defense for thorny, emergent performance and reliability issues onboard. Your software systems are where autonomy algorithms, after vetting in simulation, hit the road and have to deal with real sensor data, freezing temperatures, and the realities of operating a test fleet.

This role is highly integrated with both autonomy engineering and test operations. This is the equivalent of a “full stack” position for robotics, ranging from low-level C++ performance optimization to building better tools to streamline track testing. You will be frequently asked to debug new systems to help solve the problems where all others have given up. You will interact directly with test engineers to inform the user interfaces for your software. You will also work closely with our hardware engineering teams to set the roadmap for next-generation vehicles: benchmarking new hardware and working with suppliers to design APIs for unreleased sensors.
What You’ll Do
Evolve the fleet from a collection of individual vehicles into a living, roving network with integrated metrics and monitoring
Squeeze CPU and GPU cycles out of our limited onboard hardware resources
Optimize and extend the custom Linux distribution used on the self-driving vehicles
Build the software and data deployment system, for automatically and efficiently distributing new software releases to the fleet and orchestrating process on the vehicle
Create abstract sensor and embedded device interfaces in C++
Work with autonomy engineers to meet latency requirements for sensor data
Scale onboard and offboard systems for transporting data to/from the vehicles
Build HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) test infrastructure to automatically verify onboard code changes and profile performance
Engineering support for field testing and fleet operations

What You’ll Need
3 Minimum Years of Experience with Operating Systems, Device Drivers, Networking, Robotics Infrastructure

About the Team
This opening is for the Onboard Integration team, a part of Core Platforms. The goal of the team at the highest level is to provide low-latency, robust sensor data to autonomy algorithms. It's a simple mission but it involves every part of the stack. We are the first team of software engineers that get hands-on with new hardware, and are responsible for building the environment where we run code that has been tested offline with real hardware.

The team works in a middle layer between hardware and software, so one of the advantages is that you get to work with both sides of ATG. We are on the cutting edge evaluating next-gen hardware as well as making sure our existing fleet is as reliable as we can make it, and we're striving to provide better and easier to use APIs for autonomy engineers.

Our main focus areas include:
High-performance networking and time synchronization
E.g. optimizing the networking stack in Linux for low-latency, high bandwidth local connections
PTP and other time synchronization methods (e.g. PPS)
Network architecture, partitioning and security
Isolating infotainment traffic from sensor data, and maintaining Quality of Service
Wireless (e.g. LTE) networking
E.g. building redundancy into our networking at multiple levels
Software for fault management in safety-critical systems
Fault detection, response, containment and tolerance
Embedded device and sensor interfaces
Sensor data API design
Automated software updates and configuration management, in the style of invisible Chrome OS updates
Embedded Linux (e.g. kernel configuration and build)
Generally not writing code in the kernel itself. We would do so if necessary but if someone expected to come to this team and contribute to the Linux kernel they would be disappointed.
The “full stack” equivalent for robotics - able to solve performance issues in C++ and also understand the customer’s needs and build reasonable user interfaces (with pre-built frameworks - CSS and UX/UI expertise is not required)"

BS/BA in a software related field or incredible experience that makes us not care about a degree","Proofpoint Security Awareness Training, formally Wombat Security is seeking a Software Engineer – C# to join our growing development team at our Pittsburgh office located in the Strip District. If you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in great environment with great people, this is your chance. We’re a security software-as-a-service company so you’ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.

Q: Ok. Who are you?
A: We’re comprised of some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lots of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.

Q: What would I be working on?
A: You know all those data breaches you hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You’ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help. Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.

Q: Can you tell me a little more about your product?
A: Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess the their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cybersecurity and cutting-edge attacks, this is the where to do it. You’ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.

Q: Where is this position located?
A: The position is located at our headquarters in Pittsburgh, PA. We are located in the Strip District.

Q: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?
A: You’ll be working on a key component that has high value and visibility to the organization. It’s a polyglot environment-you might write some C# and then jump into Java, before ending the day working on some Javascript. You’ll keep in touch with the team using Slack, Google Hangouts, and even an ol' IP phone if you’d prefer.
Q: What tools do I have at my disposal?
A: Whatever enables you to do your best work with reason (A Tesla won’t help your write code faster, sorry). Most of our developers use a Windows or Mac laptop.

Q: What hours will I work?
A: We work typical office hours — but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We’re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.

Q: What technology do you use?
A: We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, Sidekiq, Redis, Ansible, Git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).
Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?
A: Here’s a bullet list of what we’re looking for:
Responsibilities:
