About the Role

We are seeking passionate engineers with strong product intuition to join our Privacy Engineering effort in Seattle. We're focusing on building both the user-facing features and internal services that give our users choice around their data, build trust, advance data privacy, and enable our business.

You should be comfortable in uncharted territory and excited to design and build city-scale systems based on research and data.

What You’ll Need

Security or privacy depth. You have knowledge and experience in approaches to securing user data and keeping it private. You have broad knowledge of integrating privacy principles in the systems and product design process.
Privacy pragmatism. You have lofty ideals for user privacy and can apply them in a business environment. You’re able to build and advocate for suitable security practices to enhance privacy.
Expertise. You have experience with building and deploying high-tier internal infrastructure at scale. You can take the lead and have a great sense of what doing ‘the right thing’ is. You might have deep knowledge of privacy enhancing technologies, e.g. data anonymization or differential privacy.

Today, if someone wants to find something to do, they spend several hours searching through Facebook, Eventbrite, Yelp, Groupon, local newspapers, or Googling to find an experience that suits them. After fruitless searching, they inevitably end up at the same restaurant, bar, or movie theatre they were last week.
Mystery is a managed marketplace that connects people to experiences in a new way. Mystery uses human-in-the-loop matching to create a curated outing based on each customer's unique preferences and price point. Aside from the necessary basic information, Mystery provides limited details on the itinerary—all in an effort to consistently surprise and delight their customers. Throughout the Mystery, customers are guided by Casey, their technology-powered concierge. By owning the end-to-end experience, Mystery removes all planning, indecision, and fear of failure that's commonly associated with planning an experience.
As a seed-stage company, our employees are presented with tremendous opportunities for both personal and professional growth. Our team is deliberately small—we're tech-first and we choose to scale our service by leveraging thoughtful automation instead of increasing our head count.

Now however, a new wave is emerging behind disruption called opportunity. Understanding data and how it affects people in places is crucial to growing your business. Since 2009, Point Inside has been creating a foundation of indoor maps. We’re enabling location-centric, digital strategies across industries by unlocking the power of the data-driven enterprise.

It uses a laser to carve and engrave products from raw materials like wood, leather, acrylic – even cardboard. If you haven’t already, check out our video on glowforge.com. While you’re there, you’ll notice something amazing: Glowforge is the largest crowdfunding campaign in history.

There is an incredible demand for what we’re creating. It’s not a geeky tool for the tech elite or a garage workshop; we’re crafting an iconic product that is going to change the way people think about creativity. Our customers include consumers, digital designers, crafters, engineers, teachers, artists, and more.

This is a full-time role in Seattle, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this alluring city.

Why we need you
One of the unusual things about the Glowforge architecture is that we moved many of the hard engineering problems from hardware to software. Our cloud service does the heavy lifting for features like alignment and autofocus. It also makes it dead easy to diagram, draw, or doodle your invention and print it directly to wood, acrylic, fabric, leather, or paper.

Our team is composed of software generalists and we expect you to be one too, but we particularly want your passion and thoughtfulness around our end-to-end web stack. While you’ll do lots of things here, you’ll be asked to tackle problems at every layer of a full-featured web stack, and will spread your knowledge and experience through an organization that is eager to learn. And there’s a lot for you to work on: you’ll be helping with everything from user-facing software to the web services that drive our hardware.

While this role is written for someone with a four-year degree and several years of industry experience, if you’re great at what you do and excited about what we do, we want to talk to you — whether you’re brand new to the industry or you’ve been a veteran architect for decades.

Here’s what you’ll be doing
First and foremost, any task that helps us create an amazing product for our customers — which will include stretching your coding skills in new directions and pitching in when your colleagues need help.
Driving the decisions about what technologies to add to the stack. We already use Rails, Node, and Python but have a lot more work to do.
Working closely with the hardware team to understand the capabilities of our product and help unlock its potential.
Participating in planning sessions with the whole product team and can help build the user stories, requirements and specifications that will drive development.
Building the software to fabricate the future – not just another CRUD app.
You need these qualifications
You write copious amounts of thoughtful, high-quality code.
You’ve been responsible for shipping a web product that people love.
You’re excited about being personally responsible for making Glowforge successful, and you’re comfortable navigating ambiguity that arises in a startup environment, adjusting to changing priorities, and moving confidently even when guidance is limited.
You’re thoughtful about systems engineering, design patterns, and algorithms.
You’re passionate about writing great software… and still know that you sometimes have to make some tradeoffs to ship quickly.
It would be nice if…
You’re experienced with back-end server technologies and designing for the *ilities (testability, maintainability, extensibility, scalability, and security-ility).
You’re familiar with hardware challenges like drivers, motion controller algorithms, and/or low-level code (you’ll be working closely with the hardware team and may have the opportunity to build low-level interfaces).
You have graphics experience.
You’re comfortable with Javascript, CSS, and HTML (big chunks of our product are user-facing web software)
This is a full-time role in Seattle, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this beautiful city. Send us a resume or a link to whatever showcases your skills the best. If a resume isn’t handy, a LinkedIn profile or GitHub account is fine.

There's one more, very important thing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We search for amazing people of diverse backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. We take care of each other to create an inclusive work environment where we love to come to work every day. We hope you can join us."

",None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"The Role

The main moving piece of the Outreach product is the system which manages communications with customers by synchronizing user inboxes. That system is owned by the Customer Engagement Actions Team. The team’s goal is to drive efficient revenue generation by enabling Outreach users to make efficient contacts, keep in touch with their customers, and comply with data management and security policies.

The calendar and email team is seeking a back-end engineer to come work with us to build the next generation of cutting-edge communication features.

About the Team

Our system handles more than one million emails and calendar events daily. Nearly everything an Outreach customer does involves our part of the system, and we never want to be in the way of our users reaching their customers - or their goals. We’re charged with designing and delivering interesting features, like automated reply detection, which requires a crisp design approach to answer nebulous and challenging problems.

We work with a disparate set of third-party APIs to implement our system, integrating with email and scheduling systems like Google Mail and Calendar, and Microsoft Office 365. Customers trust us with their privacy and data, and with their customer contacts. New legislation and practices (like GDPR) demand compliance that we take seriously, and they keep our work dynamic.

We're always concerned with making sure the outward interfaces we implement are up and running. But we’re also working to scale them to larger volumes so we can accommodate even bigger customers. Our road-map contains a rich suite of features for our customers focusing on communication flexibility and efficiency.

On the Customer Engagement Actions Team We:

Implement support for features in browser and email client add-ins
Ship code to production every day
Help our customers drive customer communication, resulting in effective and efficient sales contacts that drive their organization’s revenue
Do Agile development, with Kanban and regular retrospectives
Function in a highly progressive, quick-iteration environment focused on delivering consistent, incremental customer value
Are highly collaborative and foster a learning environment
Own the back-end implementation of the front line; a system that provides and monitors direct contact with our users and their customers over email and calendaring interfaces

Your Daily Adventures Will Include
Building applications in a modern web stack. We primarily use Ruby on Rails on the back-end, though there are services written in Go, Node and Elixir. We have data stores built on Redis, MySQL, and S3. We are beginning to adopt GraphQL. We use CircleCI/Concourse for continuous integration. Our platform runs on AWS using Kubernetes.
Work with back-end APIs from third parties to efficiently implement our features
Respond to changing requirements efficiently and responsibly
Helping us build customer trust by keeping the quality bar high and delivering well tested code

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
What We Value
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages

219,Software Engineer - Maps and Location Services,"Bellevue, WA",Bellevue,WA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field.5+ years experience in a related fieldDemonstrated proficiency with Java, C++, or equivalent object-oriented programming language.Strong problem solving and analytical abilities.Understanding of algorithmic design and complexity analysis.Strong verbal and written communication skills and an ability to work in a team environment.High sense of ownership, self-motivation, and desire to delight customers.

The Amazon Maps Data and Science team builds systems that model the real world to enable routing for drivers. We build, maintain and vend base map data, road network data, map tiles, geocodes of addresses and time estimates for service as well as transit times. We also provide a shortest path service to find fastest paths between locations and a service to optimize consolidation of stops. Together these systems help us get better at determining the locations that we go to deliver packages, figure out how to get to those locations and to estimate the effort of delivery for planning.
While it may be easy to say “Why build yet another Maps?” as a first reaction, as we go deeper into our problems, the answer becomes increasingly clear and challenging. We are building systems that enable depth focused solutions. For example, we are interested in not only getting a person to an address like 300 Boren Ave N, we are also interested in helping them find out if there is a mailing room in the building and if there is, helping them navigate quickly to that mailing room. We are also interested in accurately estimating how long it would take to arrive at the address, find the mailing room and drop a package there. We will incorporate the ability to leverage mass transit, multiple modes of transportation and traffic awareness to find the most efficient paths for our drivers. We are also interested in making it easy to calculate paths on cheap mobile devices or in simplifying the process to find an efficient path to cover hundreds of delivery points. Several of these problems require us in building systems that can work with an ensemble of models as well as support the right segmentation of inputs to make good estimates on the outputs.
There are several unsolved or partially solved problems in this space such as automatically adding new roads detected from sensor/video data into the larger road graph, deterministically detecting if a new road is in fact just a modification to an existing road (such as a change in curvature of an existing road due to a new sidewalk), accurately determining the bearing of a person when they start traveling leveraging only a single and single IMU sensor source, parsing unstructured addresses such as in countries like India, processing alternate solutions within microseconds on a mobile device without talking to a backend service and so on. The right person for this space would enjoy working in a space that requires constantly pushing both the research and -off edges to unlock solutions to such problems.The person would be building multiple ML / AI based solution and build optimized solution which can traverse over a complex graph of billions of nodes and edges.
Our key output metrics include location accuracy, coverage and accuracy of our road network for routing and users to the correct location, predictive accuracy of service and transit estimates. We also measure the operational impact of these inputs on delivery success and on the gaps between actual versus planned on-zone times, transit times and service times.

Key Responsibilities:
Participate in the design, implementation, and deployment of successful large-scale systems and services in support of our fulfillment operations and the businesses they support.Participate in the definition of secure, scalable, and low-latency services and efficient physical processes.Work in expert cross-functional teams delivering on demanding projects.Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.Understand system interdependencies and limitations.Share knowledge in performance, scalability, enterprise system architecture, and engineering best practices.
If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, know how to deliver, are deeply technical, highly innovative and long for the opportunity to build pioneering solutions to challenging problems, we want to talk to you.

Experience in large-scale maps, location, and geographic technologyExperience developing cloud software services and an understanding of design for scalability, performance and reliability.Development experience defining, developing and maintaining REST based interfacesExcellence in technical communication with peers and non-technical cohorts who may be remoteSolid knowledge of software development methodologies and best practices.Ability to tackle big, incompletely-specified problems and resolve ambiguity in the customer's favor.Experience defining system architectures and designs, exploring technical feasibility tradeoffs, and making data-driven decisions.Demonstrated ability to mentor other software developers to develop all aspects of their engineering skill sets.Ability to drive consensus within a team and influence outcomes in significant technical decision-making.Experience interviewing and evaluating potential software engineer new hires.
