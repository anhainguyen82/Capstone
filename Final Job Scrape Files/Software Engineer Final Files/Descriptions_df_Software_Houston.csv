Are you a determined programmer with a background in electronics and robotics? At LivaNova, we are developing medical device technology at a rate not seen before in the industry. Our goal is to maintain this rapid rate of quality product development through investing in world class software and automation. Medical device companies have historically lagged behind the commercial sector in terms of bringing cutting edge technology to the market. This is partially due to the higher level of rigor demanded by regulatory agencies, but also the standard of manual design and test seen across the industry that we at LivaNova seek to defy.
As our Software Developer, you will be instrumental in continuing our transformation to the best, fastest, and most cutting-edge medical device company. We need you to help us develop the next generation automation techniques and software for controlling robotics and test equipment we’ll use for rapid medical device design and development. This is not a regular software development role: it is more challenging in that it requires not only strong programming skills, but also the ability to control electronics and hardware. You will be writing software that controls something real and helping to create the most advanced product development environment in the industry.
Here’s what Year One is all about:
• Working with the other members of the electrical engineering team, to understand our products and systems and determine how to advance our development, automation, and testing capabilities for future products
• Working with quality, regulatory, and systems engineering teams to gather design input and to ensure software meets the standards of regulating bodies.
• Design the next generation architecture of the automation systems with a focus on maximizing efficiency through elements like reusable toolsets/assets.
• Developing system requirements, along with creating design specifications.
• Create software for controlling robotics and automated test and development platforms through good software development practices including unit/module and integration testing.
• Automate the validation of your software through techniques including scheduled builds, static test, unit/module/integration test libraries, and UI test automation and simulators that mimic hardware and product behavior
Realistically, you should have strong skillsets and capabilities in software development in languages such as C#, C++, Python, or Java. Familiarity with databases and SQL is a plus. You should also be familiar with electronics and have an interest in controlling hardware through software.
Whether you have recently graduated or are a software expert looking for a new challenge, apply today! Join us on our path towards redefining product development in the medical device industry and help us make a difference as we transform the lives of patients and their families with health innovation that matters. #LI-HD
