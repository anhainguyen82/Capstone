At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
What We Value
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data

About the Development Team

We're a small team that works fast. Iterating and shipping code quickly is in our DNA. Done is better than perfect, but we do our best to build systems that let us move quickly without breaking too many things.
We support many different products but internally think of them as one system with a single unified codebase. Our goal is to build centralized systems that handle the hard stuff for multiple features and products.
We live on the cutting edge of software engineering in both our frontend and backend. We rely heavily on open source tools but aren't afraid to dig in and make something better ourselves.
We're very close as a team - we work together, hang out together, eat together, and some of us even live together. Previously, The Washingtonian described us as ""DC's nerdiest group house... shaking up Washington’s oldest trade.""
Our Work Environment

We work in a vibrant, sunlit space in our modern, open concept office
Our office building is located in the heart of downtown DC, easily accessible by metro, bus, and rideshares. It is also in close proximity to great restaurants, food trucks, shopping, and popular happy hour spots
Our team loves to spend time doing fun things outside of the office, which we call Quorum Fun events. Past Quorum Fun events have included apple picking, yoga, and wine tasting
Do you want to learn what it's like to have a real impact at a fast-growing company that is changing the way the advocacy process works? If so, drop us a line. We'd love to talk to you!

Compensation Structure

Base Salary: $88,000.00 - $135,000.00 (commensurate with experience)
Plus upward base salary adjustments based upon company growth and equity
Benefits: 401(k) match, health/dental, 12-weeks paid maternity/paternity/adoption/fostering leave, unlimited PTO, and more.
Quorum Is Working to Advance Pay Equity: What Does That Mean For You?

In an effort to continue to build a diverse and inclusive work environment that advances pay equity, Quorum has implemented a “No Negotiation” policy for base salary for new hires for roles that are currently staffed by three or more team members. This means that candidates for the Full-Stack Software Engineer role cannot negotiate Quorum’s base salary offer.

Here’s our promise to you:

We will not ask you what you are currently earning.
We will consider years of relevant experience, relevant professional certifications/education, and performance expectations in setting what we believe is a competitive, fair base salary offer.
We will be transparent about our compensation structure (see above) so that all candidates have equal access to compensation information and can make an informed decision about whether or not Quorum is the right workplace for them.
If you are interested in learning more about how negotiation impacts pay equity and/or why other start-ups have decided to implement a “No Negotiation” policy of some type, here are a few resources: Project Include, AAUW, Ministry for Women, Magoosh.

Note: Quorum does not endorse or verify any of the information provided in the resources on the impact of negotiation on pay equity. We provide these resources simply to increase awareness of a topic we believe is important for both employers and candidates to consider."

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.

FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.

You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms.
Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing.
Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools.
Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies.
Python for data processing and analysis.
Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3.
Our Principles
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.
What We Value
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Willingness and interest to travel as needed.
Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

If this role takes your fancy and you are in interested in a career at Clarabridge please apply here and let's chat - we are always keen to speak to highly talented and passionate people!

The Clarabridge Engage team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people's lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.

Engage is one of the products of Clarabridge, and in the broader context of the company we focus on all types of customer feedback (like survey results and call transcriptions), and offer advanced data modelling and dashboarding features. Read on to know more about how we work.

Working at Clarabridge

Within the Engage Development team we try to make Engage as good a product as it can be, by developing features based on customer feedback, and market or product insights from the Product team. These features become projects which one or more people in the team get assigned to, based on their personal interest or knowledge related to those features. Then, the feature is built and tested in an iterative way until we have something that not only works, but that we're proud of too.

Of course, we're totally buzzword-compliant with agile, automated testing, stickies on walls, and coffee breaks.

Requirements

What we look for in people ...


The curiosity and humbleness to second-guess yourself and learn.
The patience to take some time and talk with others and share knowledge.
The courage to take on big projects with loads of responsibility and ownership.
The experience to use proven technologies, tested code, and domain language to everyone's benefit.
The pride to make the best product you possibly can.
The wisdom to leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

All jokes aside, we're looking for great full stack software engineers who are nice to work with on a day to day basis. Our product is a web application, so our main software stack has the usual parts like PHP, MySQL, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Memcached, Redis, and Node.js. There are some more exotic things in there as well, like Clojure, ReactJS, Vowpal Wabbit, and others. Knowledge of any or all of these technologies is a huge plus, as is experience with high-volume web applications, scalability, and testing.

We use continuous integration and our app is deployed by everyone in the team, multiple times a day. If you know a thing or two about deployment, server management, or monitoring, come talk to us about it! We'd love to hear your opinions.

68,Hardware/Software Design Engineer,"Fort Meade, MD",Fort Meade,MD,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.
With the ever-accelerating technological advances and growing system complexity, NSA needs Hardware/Software Design Engineers to design, develop, construct and test electronic hardware and software processing components. These components are typically subsystems of communication, collection, processing or analysis systems.
Hardware/Software Design Engineers are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Engineering, Computer Programming, Computer Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Communications Engineering. Positions may be an office directly supporting a technical mission or one of three Development Programs: the Resident Signals Engineering Program (RSE), System Engineer Development Program (SEDP) or the Information Technology Development Program (ITDP).
The Resident Signals Engineering Program is a 4-year technical development program focused on the collection, processing, and analysis of signals in any environment and in any media. The RSE Program offers selected technical personnel unique opportunities for self-directed diversity tours in core mission areas where they will learn about, and provide solutions for, many of the toughest technical problems facing the Agency.
The SEDP prepares recent college graduates (engineering-related degrees) for a career in systems engineering at NSA. Applying systems engineering tradecraft and building a network while working with leading NSA experts prepares SEDP engineers for advanced or leadership assignments. The SEDP covers the breadth of systems engineering core competencies, including technical/analytical, technical management, and organizational/business processes. During the three-year full-time program, SEDP engineers rotate assignments to gain exposure to various NSA mission areas, attend systems engineering training and visits throughout the IC, and earn DoD DAWIA and other important credentials.
The ITDP is a three-year full-time development program designed to provide entry-level information technology specialists (that is, individuals with degrees in computer science, engineering, computer security, information systems, information technology, and related degrees and experience) the opportunity to acquire the skills and technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. In this program, participants gain a depth of knowledge in a breadth of information technology disciplines, including system/security, software engineering, software project management, and system architecture. ITDP participants work in teams and with NSA technical leaders to solve current and future challenging IT problems.
The responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Design Engineer may include:
- Designing, developing, testing, and/or evaluating computer or computer-related equipment.
- Programming, modifying and/or configuring system software that manages the computer hardware and provides services to the applications.
- Applying software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify software applications.
Skills
The ideal candidate has a desire for continual learning along with excellent problem-solving, analytic, and interpersonal skills, who is:
- innovative
- well-organized
- able to handle and prioritize multiple assignments
- able to communicate effectively both orally and written
- able to work effectively across several different functional areas in a collaborative environment
Knowledge, skills, and experience in one or more of the following is desired:
- Agile Software Development
- programming languages: C, C++, Java, Java Script, etc.
- real time programming
- embedded programming
- operating system level programming
Position Summary

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
What We Value
Must be planning on graduating in 2020
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics
Advanced-level Computer Science coursework, including in algorithms and data structures; experience with Java and/or web technologies a plus
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages

Our team of software engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.

Software Engineers form the backbone of our approach - without you, we fail. It’s pretty straightforward. We’re looking for thoughtful, creative engineers who take joy in taking something from concept to reality. Creators who love technology. Our environment’s built for you: a collaborative, test driven, paired programming environment (we like to learn from each other), with the best tools we can deploy. Joel Spolsky would approve. We hope you do too.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.

FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.

You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms.
Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing.
Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools.
Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies.
Python for data processing and analysis.
Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3.
Our Principles
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.
What We Value
Active US Security clearance (or eligibility to obtain a US Security clearance).
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Willingness and interest to travel as needed.

Overview
--------

You've wrapped your arms around a few programming languages, OO programming in general, NodeJS & Go in particular, and played with some of the frameworks like Express, Hapi and so on. You have an opinion as to whether or not static typing is good and in what situations. You've developed some preferences and found out what works for you. And, let's be honest here, you're a little giddy about the power of creation at your fingertips. You love to build new things, to have the freedom to tackle interesting problems, and especially love when there are some smart, experienced engineers nearby from whom you can learn.

In school or at work, you've been the person who writes unit tests for even the smallest projects. And you've found it doesn't take you any more time to finish your assignments than everyone around you. While they're sweating and scrambling to figure out why something broke, you're calmly writing the test for the last corner case to prove to yourself that it works.

Through the technology this team develops and runs, we're empowering our analysts to accomplish as much as they can with their time, while being fully transparent with our customers with what we're doing with their alerts and their data. We do this through automating workflows and data retrieval, so our users can spend time analyzing data, not acquiring it.

Does this whet your appetite? If this sounds like you, then we believe you'll love our team, and we'd love to talk to you.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems.

The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration.

You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Typescript and React are central to our front-end development.
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library.
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github.
What We Value
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in Javascript and an understanding of how web technologies work.
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems.
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
