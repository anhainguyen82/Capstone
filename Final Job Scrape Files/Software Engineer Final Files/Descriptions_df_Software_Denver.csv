About Engage Mobilize

Engage Mobilize was founded in 2016 under its parent company Engage Management. Engage Management is a boutique energy consulting firm that specializes in driving operational efficiencies into drilling and completion projects worldwide. Efficiency is always benchmarked on the ability to save time and reduce costs. The leadership team and consultants that founded the company always took issue with the way the capital burn and expense allocation were accounted for at the field level. Hence, Engage Mobilize was drawn up on a napkin.

Field ticketing, in essence, is a required control measure but wastes uncountable resources and capital for both Operators and Service Contractors. As a team, we are not the first to identify this massive waste of time that slows and burdens our industry, but we are in fact the first to build a platform that both sides of the transaction can identify with. Our leadership’s experience with consulting on the corporate side coupled with their dirty work boots & faded FRs led to the development of a digital field ticketing solution that respects everyone’s workflows and simply makes sense. Our company understands the “real” workflow at the field level that is intrinsic to driving the total success in a basin for both the E&P’s and the Service Providers that support them."

",None Found,None Found,None Found,"Pivotal's Story VIDEO ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-H1aJJpm0U )

Always be kind: a simple daily affirmation and one that feels more like a personal mission statement than a corporate motto -- but Pivotal isn't just any corporation. Underpinning our world-class capabilities in cloud-native software delivery and agile development methodologies is one common thread: empathy. Not only do we want to transform the way the world builds software, we also want to make sure that sustainable pace, kindness, and diversity are at the core of every enterprise.

Known for taking an iterative approach, our 2000+ employees are empowered every day to help shape the way we build software. Pivotal is committed to open source, a diverse culture ( https://content.pivotal.io/blog/diversity-and-inclusion-in-everyday-work ), and fostering safe spaces for all of our individual employees.

You

You've excelled in your computer science curriculum, and think that writing code 40 hours a week sounds like fun, not punishment.

You judge your success by the success of your team; you are interested in learning about distributed systems; and you are excited to work with open source software.

You are Junior or above, as this is a challenging internship where you will be pair programming with experienced engineers on real problems.

Us

Agile concepts are at the core of our process. We have a whole host of Pivotal Practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation.

We stick to a strict 8 hour a day schedule (with flexible start and end times). Although on-call rotations are part of most teams incidents are exceedingly rare.

A majority of our time is spent pairing in our Denver office ( https://pivotal.io/locations/denver ) but enabling remote teamwork is becoming increasingly important. We use Slack ( https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/ ) to stay connected and Screenhero or Tmux for pairing. We are working hard to make sure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems.

You'll rarely be alone when developing; from pairing all day to 1 on 1 time with your manager, there is always a Pivot there to lend a helping hand. Mentorship from senior engineering leadership is built right into our process - you'll always be empowered.

Making an investment in each Pivot's professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage you to go to conferences or purchase those pricey O'Reilly books - and we'll give you a budget each year to do it.

Your Day

As cliche as it may sound, every day is completely different from the next. We have a general framework ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvjPSz8Xs7Q ) for what our day looks like and the majority of it will be spent with your pair:

9:00 AM - Office-wide stand-up to build office cohesion and start the day off together.

9:10 AM - Team standup - discuss any blockers, choose pairs, maybe even tell a joke.

9:30-12:30 PM - Start pairing, tackle an open GitHub issue and open a pull-request.

12:30-1:30 PM - Lunch! Eat on the balcony, run an errand, or join a book club.

1:31-6:00 PM - Get back with your pair and start an acceptance test for a big feature.

While that schedule does look busy, don't worry - we take ample breaks throughout the day. Take a walk by the river, read a book on the balcony, play a game of ping pong, or chat with co-workers at the snack bar. Sustainable pace is held in high regard. We know there is a life outside of work, we want you to be able to spend time with family and friends. We understand that attending ballet recitals is as important as building great software.

Desired Skills/ Experience:

Ability to dive into a polyglot codebase and contribute while learning
Experience and/or interest in Test Driven Development (TDD) and agile methodologies
Currently enrolled in a Computer Science or related program, with upper division standing.

Cloud Foundry engineers participate in an on-call rotation with their team to support software they work on.

Portland, Oregon (or Remote)
Your Opportunity
The Ruby Agent team is looking for a senior software engineer to help us build lightweight, dependable data collection software that our customers trust enough to put into their production applications.
We’re a small, close-knit team. We work together and are always learning.
We are excited to consider a remote engineer for this role in the Pacific Standard Time zone. If you are not in the PST zone, you must be willing to work within our normal office hours. Remote team members will be expected to work out of their home office and must have successfully worked remotely before.
What's Interesting About This Job
Our code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications. While we have no control over the hosts and environments our agent runs in, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.
Our agent needs to slip into these varied environments, into an application, and figure out where the interesting bits are. There it sits, tiny and silent, gathering timings and other data to give our customers visibility into the real performance of their apps.
We write code for the wild, and it is not easy. But we have been doing this for years, and would love to share what we’ve discovered. Ideally, you have things to teach us, too.
What You'll Do
You will help us build and maintain the Ruby Agent and other data collection software for the Ruby community.
You will write tests. With our comprehensive test suite, we make sure everything we ship is well tested. We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure each release is thoroughly tested and dependable.
You will support our agent, assisting our Technical Support Engineers. We take support rotations where we help customers solve issues and get the most of the agent. We come away from these rotations with ideas of how we can improve our agent to serve our customers better.
While our team charter is well-defined and fairly narrow, we still have quite a diversity of tasks.
Team Traits
Accountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.
Attention to detail: We do excellent work every time, and help each other strive for this excellence.
Ruby expertise: We write Ruby code that metaprograms our customers' Ruby code, and which has to run on multiple versions of Ruby and JRuby.
Teamwork: We work closely together and believe in the power of pairing. It’s a great way of sharing information and ensuring quality. And it’s more fun!
Strong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.
“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.
Your Qualifications
Must-have:
Experience writing efficient Ruby. Customers run our code in their production systems. In order to keep our footprint light, we are on the lookout for unnecessary object allocations and overly complex code.
Experience reading through source code for popular libraries, find out how they work, and find the best places to hook our instrumentation code into them.
Experience writing comprehensive tests.
Not Sure If This Is You?
We are particularly interested in having a diverse team, with a broad set of skills and viewpoints. If this seems like your dream job, but you're not sure if you qualify, apply anyway! We'll carefully consider every applicant that takes the time to apply for this specific position. We'll either move forward with you, find other teams that might be a better match, keep in touch for later opportunities, or thank you for your time.
When you apply, be sure to include a cover letter telling us what interests you about this position and why you think it would be a good fit for you. Cover letters matter to us — we really read them.

We offer:
Large organizational scale (60+ engaged and productive engineering teams)

DISH is a Fortune 250 company with more than $13 billion in annual revenue that continues to redefine the communications industry. Our legacy is innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo, including reinventing ourselves.

Additionally, you may be called upon to perform troubleshooting of issues with our systems since we follow the ""you build it, you run it"" operational model.

This Software Engineering Internship opportunity will allow you to develop relevant and valuable skills that will help you succeed in your career. However, we think once you join our team, you may not want to leave!

Benefits
Individual Benefits Account (IBA)
In order to attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:
Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental
100% Medical Reimbursement
Time Off With Pay
Profit Sharing Plan
401k
Educational Benefits
Additional Income
IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.

Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)
The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.

Stock Options
Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.

Flex Time
Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

We disrupted the pay-TV industry in the mid-90s with the launch of the DISH satellite TV service, taking on some of the largest U.S. corporations in the process, and grew to be the fourth-largest pay-TV provider. We are doing it again with the first live, internet-delivered TV service – Sling TV – that bucks traditional pay-TV norms and gives consumers a truly new way to access and watch television.

Now we have our sights set on upending the wireless industry and unseating the entrenched incumbent carriers.

We are driven by curiosity, pride, adventure, and a desire to win – it's in our DNA. We're looking for people with boundless energy, intelligence, and an overwhelming need to achieve to join our team as we embark on the next chapter of our story.

Opportunity is here. We are DISH.

Our Company and Vision:
At AimLock, we believe the good guys should always have a clear edge over the bad guys, whether in war or while keeping the peace. So, we adopted a simple but ambitious mission: To enable the US and its allies to dominate the firefight with aiming technologies that engage instantly and never miss.

After years of research and development, we created AimLock technology, and the world will never be the same.

Headquartered in Denver, CO, AimLock was founded in 2013 by a group of industry leaders and armaments experts.

That's why we work closely with our customers to figure out exactly what they want and then build them the product that best meets their needs.
We work on products in a diverse set of industries. From medical to industrial to consumer products, there's no telling exactly what's going to come through the door. And that's the way we like it. Each new product is a chance to learn and do something new.
We don't just develop software either. We have teams of mechanical and embedded systems engineers as well. Many of our software projects involve these other disciplines too.
Job Details
As a small company with a corporate culture of collaboration, if you join our software team you'll report directly to the Director of Software Engineering.
You'll be assigned to a small project team with a few other engineers. They probably won't all be software engineers, but they'll all be interesting and you'll be able to learn something from each of them. You'll regularly check-in with a senior member of the software team who will make sure you're getting the most out of your experience.
Depending on the needs of the product, we develop mobile, desktop and embedded applications. We also do some web development from time-to-time. We can't tell you exactly what kind of project you'll work on, so it's a bit of a gamble. Whatever it is though, you’ll work on real projects that impact the real world.
You should know at least one of: C, C++, Java or C#. You should also have a basic knowledge of design patterns and algorithms. Above all else though, you'll need to be willing to dive in and learn something new.
At Syncroness, sometimes we say that ""we specialize in doing things we've never done before"" and we'll need you to embrace that same spirit. We'll be here to support you, but you can't shy away from a challenge.
Communication skills and the ability to work in a team are really important to us too. Our best successes come from teams that work well together. Our best teams are those that can communicate well (both within the team and with the customer).
We realize that you're still in college and aren't an expert in anything yet (we're still learning too!). But if you love to solve problems with software and you're willing to roll your sleeves up and figure things out, we're excited to work with you."
