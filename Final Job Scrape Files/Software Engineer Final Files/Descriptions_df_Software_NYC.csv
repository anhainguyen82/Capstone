Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” FDSEs lead the process of finding answers.

As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.

You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset. For example, we currently use:

A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.

A career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could. As you rotate among teams, you'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, finance, and law enforcement. You'll learn from experts in these fields about their problems and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them. Questions that seem simple from the outside will quickly become complex as you consider the nuances and consequences of every possible answer.

Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms.
Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing.
Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools.
Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies.
Python for data processing and analysis.
Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3.
Our Principles
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.
What We Value
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision
Willingness and interest to travel as needed
Must be planning on graduating in 2020

18,Algo Software Engineer (C++/Python),"New York, NY 10005",New York,NY,10005,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"At HRT, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. We make the world's markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.

Algo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT's trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don't mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.

Our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company's Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.

We are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that's probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java.

Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:


When he's not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David's writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like ""one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays"". He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.
Kai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.
Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates' happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.

Culture:
Hudson River Trading (HRT) brings a scientific approach to trading financial products. We have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments for research and development. Our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.

At HRT we come from all sorts of backgrounds: mathematics, computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering. We're a community of self-starters who are motivated by the excitement of being at the cutting edge of automated trading.

---------------------------

B12's engineering team views software as a craft, but improving the world as the reason to practice it. Our engineers are responsible for prioritizing, conceptualizing, co-designing, building, testing, and engaging users for any concept we are building out. We're generalists in encouraging each other to experience the full stack, but we're also aware of each other's preferences in the stack. We mentor and teach where we can, both inside and outside of the company.

We value sharing our work with the outside world. Our team has published papers ( http://orchestra.b12.io/#motivation ) on forming expert flash teams and machine-mediated worker hierarchies. We've baked our research into Orchestra ( http://orchestra.b12.io/ ), the system that coordinates our expert and machine teams, and released Orchestra into open source to contribute our software back to the community.

We hope our engineers have more longevity than any one tool we use, but here is a sampling of our current thoughts about technology:


We live on Python/Django and JavaScript/React.
We store blobs in Amazon's S3, munch on them in Amazon's EC2, develop in Docker, and deploy containers to Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
We believe Postgres should be the first system you consider when you think about persisting structured data.
We have near-full test coverage on the backend, are increasingly pleased with our frontend tests, and embarrassed about our integration tests.
We set up continuous integration and deployment because, while this model comes with its own pains, we've disliked being on fixed release schedules on previous projects.
We like to move fast and support point-in-time recovery : ).

32,Junior Software Engineer (Finance Technology),"New York, NY",New York,NY,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Who we are

You'd be joining a small, diverse team of people, who are passionate about what they do, see value in constant learning and who like to play board games over lunch. Most importantly, we don't like to be bored at work, so we simply never let that happen.

Our story

Finance Tech came to existence less than 3 years ago, when we - viagogo - realized, that the best team to ensure our financials were timely, accurate, and scalable was one that sat close to our marketplace. With that we decided to give the engineering team the mission of improving the existing, heavily manual, processes.

It started as a part-time job owned by the Database Team, but grew quickly to become an autonomous team, rapidly gaining more and more responsibilities as the business expanded. Currently the team is made of two SQL / database engineers (dabbling in C# / MVC / js / .net core) and an analyst with an accounting background. We're responsible for basically anything around economics & money movement. viagogo supports nearly 40 currencies in over 100 countries, and no marketplace can grow without a robust payments & finance foundation to support it. Our role is to scale the financial backend of a high-volume, multi-currency, global marketplace.

Our responsibilities

Some examples of what we own:

Capturing & tracking of every economic event going through our business, making sure it stays immutable, and makes it to our accounting system
Month end processing - automated generation of all marketplace-related financial journals (revenue, costs, tax, seller obligation etc.) following accounting principles, to be uploaded to the accounting system by the Finance Team
User payouts - automated process of paying our sellers on time, following the correct schedule, using correct payment method, currency etc.
Cash reconciliation - marketplace vs payment processing providers: did we charge / pay what we think we did (automated process + reconciliation tooling + troubleshooting / preventing deltas in the future)
Seller obligation - tracking, process, tooling, answering questions such as: how much money do we owe to whom, in which currency, when are we going to pay them, why haven't we paid them yet
Value add tax & payments compliance

Our strengths & what you can learn from us


SQL / Database - as a close neighbour of the Database Team, we feel pretty confident about our SQL knowledge & DB best practices. Our 'database development' goes beyond writing simple SELECT statements.
Finance & accounting - We also have a former accountant on the team. We don't do accounting as such, but we do design all financial processes that eventually get booked into our accounting system. Understanding where things should go without bothering Finance Team every 10min is invaluable.

We don't expect you to become a database or accounting master, but you'll be surrounded by people with varied skillsets who are happy to help you grow and expand your knowledge.

What you'll be doing:

Ensure the correct & timely capture of every monetary event happening within the business
Open doors to new supply opportunities by building and maintaining a flexible user payout system
Improve security & quality of the overall system by smart permission management, refactoring architecture of existing processes, developing guidelines & building new tools that implement them
Improve payment management tooling & finance features available to the internal users to provide better service to our customers
Scale both pay-in and pay-out cash reconciliation systems to consider new requirements (new payment providers, improved tracking, faster reconciliation)

Our ideal candidate is someone who:

Has a strong work ethic and a high level of motivation
Has a true interest in finance
Has the ability to explain the impact of their work on business
Has demonstrated a superior attention to detail
Has a passion for delivering products end-to-end: from idea, through prioritization and planning, to delivery and maintenance
Has dealt with the consequences of making an engineering mistake and has a strong sense of ownership
Knows the value of communication
Knows that aiming for perfection is vital when it comes to finance & accuracy is key, but at the same time understands that perfection is unachievable

2+ years of experience with C# or other programming language
Exposure to or experience within a finance / payments area of engineering

We're seeking Engineers who:

are passionate about technology
are excited to learn new things
are independent
work well with others
can join our small team in NYC!

What is it like being a Software Engineer at OkCupid?
The OkCupid backend engineering team is comprised of six engineers building the infrastructure that powers matching algorithms, messaging, and more for millions of users every day. Because the team is so small relative to our user base, each engineer here has full ownership of what they're working on and the opportunity to have a huge amount of direct consumer impact. We also have a lot of input into both technical and product design, and we are involved in all parts of the product process from ideation to deployment, so everything we build is something that we also had a hand in designing.

Another result of our lean team size is that each of us has the opportunity to be exposed to many different parts of our stack and learn a ton. To give one concrete example, one backend engineer has in the past year alone: built the foundation of our anti-spam infrastructure, built out the backend support for a completely new messaging paradigm, and built the foundation of our machine learning infrastructure.

We work closely with the other engineering and product teams across the company to figure out the best ways to help people find meaningful relationships, and then to turn those ideas into live product features. These changes can include adding brand new features and experiences to the site; tweaking our matching algorithm to make sure that users see the best possible matches; or improving our infrastructure to ensure that users are always able to find matches and that we can continue to move quickly and improve their experience.

Some things you'll do:

Analyze site activity and user behavior to figure out what makes people click
Work with product and engineering teams to figure out the best ways to help our users find love
Design, implement, and deploy features and improvements based on these findings
Some examples of projects that backend engineers are currently or were recently working on:
Discovery: building a new site experience to help users find other users based on shared interests, question answers, etc.
Matching algorithm: optimizing the algorithms that decide whom users see in different places across the site
ML infrastructure: building out infrastructure to allow our engineers and data scientists to quickly and easily deploy newly trained machine learning models into production
Core infrastructure: designing the future foundation of OkCupid's backend infrastructure, from deployments to testing environments to monitoring and alerting

Some things you'll need:

3+ years' experience designing and building software
Expertise with C++, Go, Java, or similar
Experience designing and building scalable and reliable distributed systems – preferred
Experience working on consumer-facing products – preferred

What's in it for you?


Competitive salary and full benefits, including Medical, Dental, Vision, and 401k
Workstation and tools of your choice
Paid attendance to conferences
Daily complimentary catered lunch from some of NYC's top restaurants, and an endless supply of snacks and drinks
Company funded happy hours/events
Discounted membership to some amazing NYC facilities including Chelsea Piers Gym
Generous maternity and/or paternity leave and contributions towards fertility preservation

What Is It Like to Work Here?

The easiest way to answer this is to check out our great rating on Glassdoor, take a deep dive into a few of our employee profiles, or look into some of our recent awards, like Crain’s Best Places to Work. Also, don’t forget to peep our Instagram.

For more detail, though, here are a few of our favorite things:
1. We want people who elevate the game - and offer meaningful equity in our fast-growing company to compensate for top performers.
2. We offer generous medical, dental, and vision insurance—you shouldn’t have to stress about your health. (And less stress makes you healthier, right?!)
3. Yes, your Fundera family is very important, but yours at home matters most. That’s why we offer incredibly generous maternity and paternity leave, have a family-friendly office, and love nothing more than seeing our Fundera kiddos at company events and socials.
4. Everybody needs a little R&R—but we want our team to have more than just a little. You’ll get flexible PTO and we mean legitimately flexible PTO.
5. We sponsor regular catered lunches with really cool speakers (like the founders of Birchbox, CityRow, and Percolate). We also regularly host company happy hours, and other events such as employee-led trivia and visits to customers. It’s important to bring our team together as much as possible.
6. Transparency is what our product is built on—and so is our culture. Whether that means regular all-hands meetings, board decks circulated every month, or a highly-accessible leadership team, we’re all stakeholders in this company and never forget that.

Ultimately, at Fundera, you get to come to work with a group of supportive, talented, ambitious individuals who will teach you something new every day, whilst building a product that will truly and actually change the lives of America’s small businesses and job creators. We think it’s pretty cool, and think you will, too.

The team launched Paxos Confirmation Service in late 2018 and has already confirmed well over 100,000 trades with aggregate notional values in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our rapidly growing FinTech company. This is the opportunity to be part of a fast-paced, small, and flat organization responsible for developing our exciting cutting-edge products from design to production, as well as overseeing multiple projects from end-to-end. If you're looking for an opportunity to directly see your work impact the business and our clients on a global scale, then this is a great role for you!

Who You Are:

You are a rock solid engineer who is master of at least one domain. This could be a functional domain like Securities or Precious Metals or a technical domain like Distributed Systems, Cryptography, Databases, AWS, etc.
You demonstrate a solid understanding of core engineering concepts. Strong understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms
You are able to understand and articulate the design and architecture of the entire system.
You embody our culture and values ( https://medium.com/paxos/the-paxos-approach-to-core-values-and-why-it-matters-665e68551f79 )
You feel comfortable working in a tech-driven environment with the ability to coordinate across several stakeholder groups (Engineering, Operations, Marketing, HR, etc.)

What You'll Do:

You will produce a work output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into sub-tasks, and completing the sub-tasks with relative ease – own design, coding, testing all the way through deployment of each of those sub-tasks.
You will identify and proactively tackle technical debt before it grows into something that requires significant up-front work to resolve. A rule of thumb is to start looking into root cause of issues whenever there is noise. There is no smoke without fire.
You will strike the right balance between fixing the problem at hand and focusing on finding the root cause of problem. For example, if it's a production issue the priority is to fix the immediate problem and collect all the data necessary for root cause analysis. In a non-production environment, the focus should be on finding the root cause and fixing it the right way to make sure the problem doesn't occur again.
You will be actively involved with and mentor junior engineers doing code reviews resulting in up leveling the skill sets for the entire team

Caper’s autonomous checkout technology is plug and play, meaning it requires no in-store renovation, no operational overhaul, no heavy computations or endless image labeling. Any retailer can buy the carts and their entire store is upgraded with cashierless capabilities. Caper costs less than 1% of Amazon Go's infrastructure. We are already live in-stores and our customers love us!

Caper is the fastest-growing company in retail automation technology and is backed by Lux Capital, First Round Capital, Y Combinator along with top executives from Google, Walmart, Instacart, Plated, and Albertsons. While e-commerce accounts for 8% of total retail spending, Caper is innovating the other 92% of the untapped offline retail potential.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
What We Value
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data

About the job
Hope is not a strategy. Engineering solutions to design, build, and maintain efficient large-scale systems is a true strategy, and a good one.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google's services—both our internally critical and our externally-visible systems—have reliability and uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever-watchful eye on capacity and performance.

SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems—we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. As SREs are responsible for the big picture of how our systems relate to each other, we use a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless postmortems and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day-to-day work.

SRE's culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.

Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.
How we work
Happy Customers > Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be ""pure.""
Vision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee - these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.
Writing > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.
What we're looking for
We’d particularly like to get to know you if:
you communicate with clarity and precision. We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.
you're passionate, even if it's not about analytics. There should be something you know more about than anyone on our team.
you’ve written 10,000 lines of code that look embarrassing in retrospect. ... and you've written 10,000 lines of good code since then.
you like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes. We aren't robots.
What we're building
Under the hood, Heap is powered by node.js, Scala, Spark, ZooKeeper, Kafka, and CitusDB. Our app-layer stack is TypeScript, React, mobx, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
We're working on:
Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies. We also support materializing massive retroactive datasets into our customers' cloud data warehouses. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.
Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe). All of this has to happen with virtually no performance cost or integration overhead.
Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.

Our HQ is in SF, and we have an office in New York, but a large part of our engineering team is remote. We cover relocation costs, and can sponsor visas. We'd love to hear from you, no matter where you are!

Heap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.

People are what make Heap awesome. Regardless of age, education, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any personal characteristics, we want everyone to feel welcome. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive equal opportunity workplace everyone can call home."

At Twitter, our advertising business went from zero to two billion in revenue faster than any other company. It’s critically important to show that value in a way advertisers understand, trust, and can dig into for more detail.


Our team is responsible for all interfaces between Twitter ad products and advertisers such as ads.twitter.com and the ads API. We aim to build high quality, full-stack products that make it easy for advertisers to create and measure their campaigns and objectives.

What We Do:
Do you want to make a huge impact while working with large data sets at a really big scale? Our teams work closely with other Twitter businesses while pulling together a world-class, highly efficient, scalable and measurable offering for our advertisers. We are hiring software engineers in the following areas:

Ads Measurement - Does advertising work on Twitter? We provide data to prove the effectiveness of ads campaign. It’s the only way for our advertisers to understand the influence of each advertising impression on a consumer’s awareness, intent, and purchase decision. We are building a highly accurate real-time streaming system with the largest scale of data at Twitter to display ads attribution data. We also provide advertiser measurement report based on experiment-based big-data analytics system which enables them to optimize and derive their business value.
MAP - Mobile App Promotion team is tasked with dramatically improving the predictability that advertisers can expect from us when wanting to spend on Twitter to drive app installs and re-engagement. Today, this is seemingly random and can vary from day to day. We are responsible for end to end ownership of the system spanning the whole stack. Success will require us to focus on 3 broad areas - stability, performance and scale. Help us define and implement new architecture critical to our growing business.
Video Ads - Twitter is the only place where conversation is tied to video and the biggest live moments, giving brands the unrivaled ability to connect with leaned-in consumers who are shaping culture. We own all video monetization at Twitter, supporting well over $1B in annual revenue across our suite of products. We are a predominantly back-end product team, working to drive up value for users, publishers, and advertisers.
Creatives - The Creatives team owns the interaction between Ads and the consumer experience. This is reflected both in building formats and experiences that are valuable to consumers, and in building tools that guide advertisers in developing campaigns in order to optimize their impact to Twitter's end-users.
Planner - Ads Planning and Forecasting team’s mission is to build the forecasting layer for various ad products here at Twitter. We predict unique users and impressions they can see for a given budget. We look at the past data and use various statistical and programmatic modelling to accurately calculate the future campaign performance metric (unique reach, pricing, average frequency).
Ad Quality - The Ad Quality team designs and builds systems that enable effective and accurate review of promoted Twitter products. We create automated review processes, utilizing numerous signals, including machine learning models developed by the team.
Ads API - The Advertiser API platform serves some of the world’s biggest brands, agencies, and Ad Tech partners, solves their campaign, creative, and audience management needs and provides insights and analytics. We’re focused on developer efficiency, driving an API first philosophy and ensuring that our platform is stable, extensible, and scalable.
Businesses Foundations - Our largest agencies and advertisers contribute most of our revenue, and we need to scale our systems to handle the next wave of growth. Come join us in rethinking our current models/systems and building product infrastructure that unifies all customer activity and solves some of the most painful efficiency and workflow problems for our largest customers.
Our Engineering Environment:
At Twitter, we believe that good system designs require collaboration so that the end result is simple yet sophisticated. We promote openness by contributing to open source and sharing our data through Twitter’s API (learn more here - https://dev.twitter.com/ads/overview). Our technology stack is mainly based on Scala and Java on the backend, with data analytics systems built on Heron and Hadoop.

Who You Are:
You are a proven engineer. Not only strong technically, you have shown that you can work effectively with product managers, designers and other engineering teams.
You have a fierce sense of ownership, caring deeply about the quality of everything that you deliver into your customers' hands.
You love the challenge of engineering, and are confident in your ability to bring clarity and direction to ambiguous problem spaces.

106,Software Engineer (Hardware Team),"New York, NY",New York,NY,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"About Oden:

We are on the brink of the next industrial revolution.

Manufacturing has long been an analog world, but this is about to change. By introducing machines to the digital world, there’s a staggering opportunity for efficiency and production leaps. Oden is driving this revolution. We’re on a mission to eliminate waste in manufacturing.

We have combined industrial hardware, wireless connectivity, and big data architecture into one simple platform so all manufacturers can analyze and optimize their production, from any device. Efficiency, sustainability, and competitiveness are democratized.

Why We Do It:

We like to enable those who make things - to make more, to waste less, to serve their customers, and to thrive in a competitive world. Help enough makers, and the world can give us all the abundance we want for less cost and environmental impact. We’re on the verge of a 4th industrial revolution that begs for absolute efficiency in all factors of life. We plan to deliver that to everyone who makes things. Check out some of our team members discussing life at Oden: Oden's Culture of Empowerment and Impact

You:

Are never satisfied with the way things are, but excited about the way things could be.
Tinker. You embrace different technologies and want to see how they can work together.
Are happy to put on steel toe boots and hit the factory floor to work with the production manager.
Empathize with customer needs while also looking towards long-term innovation.
Live by transparent and scientific thinking. You put in the work to find the best ideas with those around you, without ego.
The Role:

Software Engineers on the Hardware team build features that enable our embedded devices to talk to machines on the factory floor, connecting manufacturing data to our platform that delivers valuable insights. Some questions we explore are:

How do we efficiently scale and support large fleets of devices?
How do we build robust and fault tolerant software to talk to a wide array of industrial machines?
How do we adopt industrial automation technologies into our own development practices and understanding of new verticals from plastic extrusion to injection molding and others.
Software Engineers are self-starters and team players, during the product development lifecycle they collaborate closely with deployments, customer success, product, and data science to design the best solution. We believe that the best way to understand the needs of our users is to stand in their shoes, so occasionally we’ll tour factories and engage face-to-face. This position comes with steel toe boots.

What We Do:

117,Software Engineer,"New York, NY 10010",New York,NY,10010,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"About Vericred
Vericred is an early stage, venture funded healthcare data services company enabling innovation in and around health insurance and employee benefits.
Our vision is to become the Sabre of health and benefits – the data and services layer on which others build health insurance and employee benefit technology solutions. Today our health insurance data platform, which consists of health plan benefit and rate, provider-network and formulary data, is the foundation on which health technology companies build innovative solutions.

About You
We are currently looking for a Software Engineer to join our growing team. The majority of this position's work will be back-end, though someone with full-stack experience is preferred. You will work directly with our CTO, VP of Engineering and other engineers to build our expanding healthcare data platform. You will have a high degree of autonomy and influence on the culture and direction of the technical organization. As a Software Engineer you will:
Be passionate about building products
Have 5+ years of experience working within a team on web applications (bonus points if it was a start-up)
Have an opinion on tools, techniques and what makes great code
Be an expert in Ruby on Rails

Building Great Products with Great Practices
We are data people. Process driven, organized and obsessed with the details. We're dedicated to using the right procedures at the right time: Lean/user testing for Product, Agile/XP for development, Kanban for data. We use whatever practice is most appropriate, and your voice will be important in building new team processes.

The Vericred Perspective
We love our work, but we also recognize the importance of work-life balance. We want you to grow as we grow. We hope you are passionate about something besides healthcare data, and we hope you'll share your passions at one of our personal interest talks. We are active participants in the NY Tech Meetup scene. We hold regular company-wide events like bowling, happy hours, movie nights, yoga - the list goes on. We provide unlimited snacks and drinks (yes, we are foodies), and our open vacation policy encourages you to responsibly take time off when you need it.

What We Offer:
Competitive Salary
Equity Participation
Health Benefits
401K with matching
Flexible PTO
Stand-up desks

Why It All Matters
The development of modern applications for evaluating, enrolling in and using health insurance and employee benefits has been constrained by the lack of a centralized, structured data source. And yet these coverages are critical to one's physical and financial health. Vericred's role is to make the data easy, so that others can build features, functionality and user experiences to solve a myriad of health insurance and benefit related problems. With a mission to enable innovation through data, the team at Vericred is proud to be a fundamental part of the transformation of health and benefits.
Insuretech is one of today's fastest-growing sectors and our team is pouring the data foundation. Do you think you are a fit for this role? We would love to hear from you!

Who are we?

Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company tackling the challenges of urban growth. Our vision for cities is rooted in a cross-disciplinary approach that is reflected in our team, composed of experts from real estate, government, finance, technology, engineering and more. Since our founding in 2015, we have evolved into an organization of over 100 employees based primarily in New York and Toronto.

We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it.

What is the role?

As a software engineer, you will work across the organization and use technology to inform our decisions and bring our vision to life. We must create innovative products that will push the boundaries of traditional thinking in urban environments while protecting user privacy and security. This will involve solving complex computational problems, dealing with messy sources of data, and building systems that will scale.

Our software engineers are utility players who support different product areas. You will work across software and hardware, and develop deep partnerships with our UX designers, product managers, and subject matter experts (e.g. architecture, housing affordability, mobility) to deliver products to unlock the true potential of a place. This is not a standard software engineering position.

This is a role for upcoming graduates. The expectation is you will start in the Summer of 2020.

What you have to achieve:

Within your first month, you build a deep understanding of Sidewalk Labs' current initiatives and technology infrastructure (Python, Go and Typescript running on the Google Cloud Platform/Kubernetes), coding style and standards, and have contributed code to the repository.
By the end of month 3, you will have added features to our existing projects, and prototyped at least one new idea.
From here, your role will continue to evolve – we're still a small team. The types of problems we are trying to solve could include:
How can technology support city leaders and planners understand their city and make good decisions?
How do we use technologies like self-driving cars, ubiquitous networking and widespread environmental sensors to maximize their positive impact on the future of the city?
How can we build digital products that will help us keep urban populations healthy and happy?
How can we make a city that gives back to the environment?
How can we create a new standard of sustainability with buildings that proactively manage and reduce energy by over 20%?

What we expect:

Know your software engineering.
Have a strong CS background in order to choose the right algorithms, systems approaches and patterns to solve problems, without reinventing the wheel.
Experience with Python and at least one systems programming language (C++, Java, or Go). Experience with Google Cloud Platform and/or Kubernetes a plus.
Act as a technologist.
Bias towards action and shipping. Once you've sketched out an idea, you find the fastest path to a prototype to prove the concept.
Strong ability to write production code quickly.
You are obsessed with privacy and constantly ask how we can build privacy into product design.
Be comfortable with a range of languages and open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a particular problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.
Solve problems, together.
Come up with novel solutions, working well with technologists and non-technologists alike.
Ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
Have flexibility to work on the company's most pressing problems.
Care.
About cities, solving hard problems, and our team's success.

The community of the future is a place for everyone, and Sidewalk Labs is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to apply. All employment is based on merit and business need.

Please note: We will not be able to extend offers until the end of the year. We recognize that this might conflict with other deadlines. The first step of the process will be a take home coding test, followed by two phone conversations and then an onsite interview.

Our hiring will remain specific and limited for the near-term and there is a small number of full-time roles available for upcoming graduates. Still, we believe in building relationships for the future when more roles are available - if you would like to stay involved and learn more about our work and be notified of future hiring you can opt in below."

DoSomething.org is a movement to create the most socially active generation in history.
We fight for our members every single day. We care deeply about activating millions of young people around the world to make impact in their communities.
We believe in young people. We believe all young people have the agency to create social change, and we provide them with the guidance to make it happen.
We don't hire just anybody. We work hella hard and we move super fast. We want people who get excited to come to work at our dynamic office every day.
We genuinely stand behind who we are and what we do. No faking it here. Everyone on our staff has their own ""why"" for coming to work every day. What will yours be?
We're looking for a seasoned engineer who enjoys architecting and has experience across the application stack. This position reports to the Director of Engineering.
What You'll Do
Work with the team to reduce the complexity of our overall system by retiring or combining existing services, developing common libraries and APIs, utilizing strategies like Serverless when appropriate, and ensuring our data pipeline is consistent across applications/services.
Advise and move our organization forward in utilizing best practices to ensure optimal availability, performance, and monitoring. Work with teams on capacity planning for our services.
Help define standards for service contracts, monitoring, performance, testing, and security. Periodically perform internal audits.
Help with infrastructure management outside of our app dev teams' purview and provide general support to developers when needed.
Mentor other developers.
What You Should Have
5+ years in developing software with experience and knowledge of DevOps methodologies/philosophies.
5+ years working on teams of developers, with mentoring experience.
Coding: You're productive in several programming languages (frontend & backend). You have experience maintaining services at scale. You can name some design patterns off the top of your head and can talk about when and where you've used them. You've built a RESTful API endpoint and fault-tolerant RESTful service integrations.
Infrastructure & systems: You are comfortable with managing infrastructure and have experience with security best practices for both infrastructure and applications. This would not necessarily be your main focus here, but your experience and ability to contribute in this area will greatly increase your impact.
Communication & Collaboration: You can communicate and collaborate within and outside of the engineering team—and you enjoy it! You're a clear, careful writer, and you know how to adjust your language to fit the technical depth of the audience.
Architecture: You've built or integrated into event-driven architectures. You know when a queue is a useful mechanism. You've designed for scale, and for non-serialized processing. You recognize and advocate for clean code and pragmatic architecture.
Open source: You have a GitHub or Bitbucket profile, and may have some interesting things there. You know how to contribute in a modern VCS (say, Git with feature branching and pull requests).
Causiness (not a word): You believe in DoSomething.org and the power of young people. You want a great career in tech, and part of that means knowing that your work contributes to a greater good. You're not satisfied with using your powers just to get more people to click on a button, or increase ad revenue.
Our Team
DoSomething.org is one of the world's largest organizations for young people and social change. We have the stability of a 25-year-old institution, but we look, feel, and operate like a tech-forward startup. We are way more fun than wherever you're working at right now.
We are a third product and engineering, out of about 60 staffers. We're a diverse team, and know our diversity makes us better technologists. We're collaborative, productive, and enthusiastic coders working with Node, React, PHP (Laravel), Python, MongoDB, and more.
How We Work
All of our code is open source on GitHub. Every PR is peer-reviewed.
We deploy as often as we need to, mostly through Slack. We host in AWS and Heroku.
We maintain quality with unit and functional testing, but we're constantly trying to improve here. We monitor with New Relic, StatHat, Runscope, and Ghost Inspector.
We're always looking for better ways to work, and end each sprint with a retrospective. We document our values and practices on GitHub.
Select Perks & Benefits:
3 weeks' vacation plus the week between Christmas and New Year's (and Summer Fridays from Memorial Day to Labor Day - office closes at 1:30), fun office environment, a spot on our summer kickball team, and occasional brownie bake-offs. Plus, you don't have to come to work on your birthday.
100% medical and dental premiums covered. Yep, you read that right.
Five (or six? We're losing count.) different ways to make coffee. We also have tea, if that's more your thing.

The Daily Beast is looking for a software engineer who is passionate about building software to power and support the success of online journalism. We as a company embrace technology and heavily invest in building custom software to support our business. The Daily Beast focuses on full stack solutions and leverages open source software where it makes sense and the engineers work on all parts of the stack each and every day.

The software that powers the company is built in house by the engineering and product team. The technology stack is 100% JavaScript, built using Node.js and React and we use PostgreSQL as our primary datastore with GraphQL to transport that data efficiently. We use all of these technologies to their fullest and have successfully built a publishing platform that handles traffic from over a million users each day. Now we are looking for another engineer to join the team as we move forward with our vision of taking online publishing to the next level.

We manage all of our own infrastructure on AWS and our services handle a huge amount of traffic. We spend a lot of our time optimizing everything we build: from hand written SQL queries to building automated tests that check our lighthouse scores. Our business has outgrown a lot of off the shelf solutions and we build lots of tools that are custom to our needs. For example, we built a custom real-time monitoring platform to watch the infrastructure and notify us of issues. We also consume a lot of our own data to power features like on site recirculation, search, and custom analytics.

About you:
For this position, we're looking for someone who is a technology generalist and has familiarity with our tech stack. You will be responsible for the development of all the platforms we support including our backend services, CMS and main website, as well as off-platform products like Apple News and native mobile apps. You should be comfortable with principles of software development: Kanban, pair programming, testing and deployment. Most importantly, you should have strong opinions about software architecture and what tools to use to get the job done.

We are a small and dynamic team that builds products from MVP to maturity and we support all of our software and infrastructure along the way. As a member of our technology team, you'll work alongside the creative director, other engineers and infrastructure/operations, product managers, and stakeholders from the newsroom and business teams.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our rapidly growing FinTech company. The Software Engineer will be a key player in the design, coding, testing and deployment of technical output.

Who You Are:

You demonstrate a solid understanding of core engineering concepts and strong understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.
You are able to understand and articulate the design and architecture of systems.
You embody our culture and values ( https://medium.com/paxos/the-paxos-approach-to-core-values-and-why-it-matters-665e68551f79 )

What You'll Do:

You will produce a work output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into sub-tasks, and completing the sub-tasks with relative ease – own design, coding, testing all the way through deployment of each of those sub-tasks.
You will identify and proactively tackle technical debt before it grows into something that requires significant up-front work to resolve. A rule of thumb is to start looking into the root cause of issues whenever there is noise. There is no smoke without fire.
You will strike the right balance between fixing the problem at hand and focusing on finding the root cause of problem. For example, if it's a production issue the priority is to fix the immediate problem and collect all the data necessary for root cause analysis.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems.

The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration.

You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Typescript and React are central to our front-end development.
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library.
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github.
What We Value
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in Javascript and an understanding of how web technologies work.
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems.
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

156,Software Engineer (Finance Technology),"New York, NY",New York,NY,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Who we are

You'd be joining a small, diverse team of people, who are passionate about what they do, see value in constant learning and who like to play board games over lunch. Most importantly, we don't like to be bored at work, so we simply never let that happen.

Our story

Finance Tech came to existence less than 3 years ago, when we - viagogo - realized, that the best team to ensure our financials were timely, accurate, and scalable was one that sat close to our marketplace. With that we decided to give the engineering team the mission of improving the existing, heavily manual, processes.

It started as a part-time job owned by the Database Team, but grew quickly to become an autonomous team, rapidly gaining more and more responsibilities as the business expanded. Currently the team is made of two SQL / database engineers (dabbling in C# / MVC / js / .net core) and an analyst with an accounting background. We're responsible for basically anything around economics & money movement. viagogo supports nearly 40 currencies in over 100 countries, and no marketplace can grow without a robust payments & finance foundation to support it. Our role is to scale the financial backend of a high-volume, multi-currency, global marketplace.

Our responsibilities

Some examples of what we own:

Capturing & tracking of every economic event going through our business, making sure it stays immutable, and makes it to our accounting system
Month end processing - automated generation of all marketplace-related financial journals (revenue, costs, tax, seller obligation etc.) following accounting principles, to be uploaded to the accounting system by the Finance Team
User payouts - automated process of paying our sellers on time, following the correct schedule, using correct payment method, currency etc.
Cash reconciliation - marketplace vs payment processing providers: did we charge / pay what we think we did (automated process + reconciliation tooling + troubleshooting / preventing deltas in the future)
Seller obligation - tracking, process, tooling, answering questions such as: how much money do we owe to whom, in which currency, when are we going to pay them, why haven't we paid them yet
Value add tax & payments compliance

Our strengths & what you can learn from us


SQL / Database - as a close neighbour of the Database Team, we feel pretty confident about our SQL knowledge & DB best practices. Our 'database development' goes beyond writing simple SELECT statements.
Finance & accounting - We also have a former accountant on the team. We don't do accounting as such, but we do design all financial processes that eventually get booked into our accounting system. Understanding where things should go without bothering Finance Team every 10min is invaluable.

We don't expect you to become a database or accounting master, but you'll be surrounded by people with varied skillsets who are happy to help you grow and expand your knowledge.

What you'll be doing:

Ensure the correct & timely capture of every monetary event happening within the business
Open doors to new supply opportunities by building and maintaining a flexible user payout system
Improve security & quality of the overall system by smart permission management, refactoring architecture of existing processes, developing guidelines & building new tools that implement them
Improve payment management tooling & finance features available to the internal users to provide better service to our customers
Scale both pay-in and pay-out cash reconciliation systems to consider new requirements (new payment providers, improved tracking, faster reconciliation)

Our ideal candidate is someone who:

Has a strong work ethic and a high level of motivation
Has a true interest in finance
Has the ability to explain the impact of their work on business
Has demonstrated a superior attention to detail
Has a passion for delivering products end-to-end: from idea, through prioritization and planning, to delivery and maintenance
Has dealt with the consequences of making an engineering mistake and has a strong sense of ownership
Knows the value of communication
Knows that aiming for perfection is vital when it comes to finance & accuracy is key, but at the same time understands that perfection is unachievable

Your skills & experience


2+ years of experience with C# or other programming language
Exposure to or experience within a finance / payments area of engineering

175,Associate Software Engineer,"New York, NY 10013",New York,NY,10013,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"BuzzFeed's Core Infrastructure Group is looking for someone taking their first steps into infrastructure software engineering, where they would be learning to help build the systems that power our sites and products. Our group's mission is to make it enjoyable, painless and safe for developers to build and manage their applications at BuzzFeed. We do this through building tools informed by best practices - which combine to create an instrumented, secure, and resilient platform.

In 2016 we built rig, a PaaS powered by Docker and AWS ECS ( https://tech.buzzfeed.com/deploy-with-haste-the-story-of-rig-ca9a58b5719a ). Since then we have continued to iterate and add to the platform. Rig now powers all of BuzzFeed's sites and products, with over 500 microservices running on it — with each one supported by the team responsible. Across the platform we've had around 150,000 deploys in the 3 years since launch.

Then, in 2017, we created a single sign on identity aware proxy — buzzfeed/sso ( https://github.com/buzzfeed/sso/ ) — which we open sourced in 2018 ( https://tech.buzzfeed.com/unleashing-the-a6a1a5da39d6 ). This has seen wide adoption by the community, in terms of contributions to our GitHub repo ( https://github.com/buzzfeed/sso ) as well as the feedback we've received from others who rely on it.

Among our more recent initiatives are a storage library, which has added zero-config provisioning of datastores for developers, and the introduction of automated, continuous deployment to production, both of which are further eliminating friction from the development process.

We're looking for an engineer who is excited to learn how tools can shape company culture, and who wants to help improve the platform that underpins BuzzFeed.

What you'll do:

In your first week you will be guided through fixing a bug in one of our services and deploying the change to production
In your first month you will learn how to build and provision our infrastructure
In your first three months you will work with your team to deliver meaningful improvements to our infrastructure
In your first six months you will facilitate a blameless retrospective
Be paired with more senior engineers who will sponsor your growth as an engineer
Learn how to build and maintain core infrastructure, including the platform that all other products and services depend on
Collaborate with domain experts across the company, including engineers building user-facing products, data scientists training novel machine learning models, and investigative journalists publishing original reports.
Work with a mix of proven and cutting edge technologies in a distributed ecosystem
Participate in collaborative code and architecture reviews
Identify patterns where we can create standardized tooling to replace previous manual or adhoc solutions.
Participate in a support rotation to help keep the tech org running smoothly, while looking for ways to increase system resiliency and to automate away your own support tasks.

Who you are:

You have an interest in learning about and working on the underlying infrastructure that powers all the services of a digital media company
You have a curious nature and like to question why things are the way they are.
You make time to review others' designs and code because you see it as an opportunity to learn
You take pride in discovering simple and elegant solutions to complex problems
You value repeatability, resilience, observability, and operational simplicity
You care about the developer experience
You think of systems as modular and composable services
You are constantly learning and re-evaluating previous assumptions
You are familiar with the foundational tools of modern development such as relational databases and REST.

Life at BuzzFeed

At BuzzFeed, we believe our work benefits from the diverse perspectives of our employees. As such, BuzzFeed celebrates inclusion and is committed to equal opportunity employment. As a BuzzFeed employee, you can expect:


A supportive, inclusive atmosphere on a team that values your contributions
Opportunities for personal and professional growth via work experience, offerings from our in-house Learning Team, engineering workshops, Employee Resource Groups, hack weeks, and more
An attractive compensation package, including salary, equity and and either pension contribution matching (UK) or 401K matching (US)
An opportunity to assist journalists on stories through our Tech + News working group ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/badge/technewsworkinggroup )
A generous and well-rounded benefits program featuring PTO and unlimited sick time, comprehensive medical benefits, a family leave policy, access to mental health platforms, retirement plans, gym and wellness discounts, team outings and much more
No shortage of snacks, catered lunches, beverages, and birthday treats
Additional PTO for participating in after hours support rotations

Experience writing efficient Ruby. Customers run our code in their production systems. In order to keep our footprint light, we are on the lookout for unnecessary object allocations and overly complex code.
Experience reading through source code for popular libraries, find out how they work, and find the best places to hook our instrumentation code into them.
Experience writing comprehensive tests.",None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"New Relic
Portland, Oregon (or Remote)
Your Opportunity
The Ruby Agent team is looking for a senior software engineer to help us build lightweight, dependable data collection software that our customers trust enough to put into their production applications.
We’re a small, close-knit team. We work together and are always learning.
We are excited to consider a remote engineer for this role in the Pacific Standard Time zone. If you are not in the PST zone, you must be willing to work within our normal office hours. Remote team members will be expected to work out of their home office and must have successfully worked remotely before.
What's Interesting About This Job
Our code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications. While we have no control over the hosts and environments our agent runs in, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.
Our agent needs to slip into these varied environments, into an application, and figure out where the interesting bits are. There it sits, tiny and silent, gathering timings and other data to give our customers visibility into the real performance of their apps.
We write code for the wild, and it is not easy. But we have been doing this for years, and would love to share what we’ve discovered. Ideally, you have things to teach us, too.
What You'll Do
You will help us build and maintain the Ruby Agent and other data collection software for the Ruby community.
You will write tests. With our comprehensive test suite, we make sure everything we ship is well tested. We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure each release is thoroughly tested and dependable.
You will support our agent, assisting our Technical Support Engineers. We take support rotations where we help customers solve issues and get the most of the agent. We come away from these rotations with ideas of how we can improve our agent to serve our customers better.
While our team charter is well-defined and fairly narrow, we still have quite a diversity of tasks.
Team Traits
Accountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.
Attention to detail: We do excellent work every time, and help each other strive for this excellence.
Ruby expertise: We write Ruby code that metaprograms our customers' Ruby code, and which has to run on multiple versions of Ruby and JRuby.
Teamwork: We work closely together and believe in the power of pairing. It’s a great way of sharing information and ensuring quality. And it’s more fun!
Strong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.
“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.
Your Qualifications
Must-have:
Experience writing efficient Ruby. Customers run our code in their production systems. In order to keep our footprint light, we are on the lookout for unnecessary object allocations and overly complex code.
Experience reading through source code for popular libraries, find out how they work, and find the best places to hook our instrumentation code into them.
Experience writing comprehensive tests.
Not Sure If This Is You?
We are particularly interested in having a diverse team, with a broad set of skills and viewpoints. If this seems like your dream job, but you're not sure if you qualify, apply anyway! We'll carefully consider every applicant that takes the time to apply for this specific position. We'll either move forward with you, find other teams that might be a better match, keep in touch for later opportunities, or thank you for your time.
When you apply, be sure to include a cover letter telling us what interests you about this position and why you think it would be a good fit for you. Cover letters matter to us — we really read them.

Warby Parker was founded with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in-house, we're able to offer top-quality glasses and sunglasses (plus an uncommonly delightful shopping experience) at a fraction of the traditional going price.

Since starting out in 2010, we've set up headquarters in New York City and Nashville, built our own optical lab, and opened retail locations all around the U.S. and Canada. As we grow, we're committed to proving that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world. For every pair of glasses we sell, a pair is distributed to someone in need—to date, that's over five million pairs.

Of course, all work and no play makes a dull workplace. Who likes that? At Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, volunteering and learning opportunities, and just great company. Teammates can also connect around common interests, backgrounds, and identities, no matter their home base, through our various employee resource groups. (We're happy to say that the Human Rights Campaign has named us a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ employees!) That sense of community keeps us excited to walk through the door every day. Good work, good people.

Some benefits and perks of working at Warby Parker:

Health, vision, and dental insurance
Flexible ""My Time"" vacation policy
Retirement savings plan with a company match
Parental leave (non-birthing parents included)
Cell phone plan reimbursement
A health-and-wellness stipend
Free eyewear, plus discounts for friends and family
And more—just ask!
