3,"Staff Software Engineer, Learning Team","San Francisco, CA",San Francisco,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Gatsby’s Learning team is looking for a software engineer to help learners of all skill levels enjoy the experience of making sites with Gatsby.
About Us
Gatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, accessible, and astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source. Our core values include transparency (our work is public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.

Details of the Role
Type of Work: Full-time employee
Location: Remote (Preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4)
Engineering Level: Staff L5/L6
Why we’re hiring
Gatsby is growing fast, and we need help improving Gatsby’s learning experience to help it realize its potential!

We’ve invested heavily in documentation, with 800+ pages worth of documentation & a beautiful and intuitive UI (if we do say so ourselves!). Yet Gatsby’s surface area is so large that the #1 request from the community is still for more and better documentation.

Why this is interesting
Gatsby’s Learning team is shaping the future of web through documentation and best practice examples; bringing React, Node.js and GraphQL to the content web; setting new standards for website performance and accessibility; and showing the potential of “content mesh” in integrating data sources.

Tens of thousands of users use Gatsby to build beautiful, performant sites every month. The Learning team are guides for these users.

What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis
As a Learning team member, your work will mostly be a mix of four things:

Create targeted, methodical documentation. We’ve identified key learning workflows to help people of all skill levels build Gatsby sites, and you’ll be tweaking and sometimes overhauling these. You’ll think carefully about key user types and creating written content, example code & repos, and audiovisual material to address their needs.

Work with the community and create community-driven documentation. We keep our pulse on the pain points the community is experiencing in order to guide our work. Perhaps a thread on Twitter reveals a patchy article that can be cleaned up with a couple hours of work and thought. In addition, much of Gatsby’s functionality is driven by the community via the plugin ecosystem. The documentation should provide an up-to-date, helpful overview of community plugins available in a given area and direct the user to further resources, even as the ecosystem rapidly grows richer.

Provide documentation-related development. We’ve been focused recently on the thousand little details that go into a beautiful and accessible UI — from a nested sidebar that expands and remembers where you are, to floating table of contents, feedback box, next/previous buttons at the bottom, breadcrumbs, a dedicated search page, and so on. We’re soon going to be crossing the boundary to creating next-generation developer documentation — allowing users to automatically track their learning journey as they complete Gatsby tutorials, bootstrapping a test suite from human-readable docs, and so on.
Support other Gatsby teams. Other teams at Gatsby, such as core (Open Source) and themes, are quickly shipping features. Everyone is expected to document their feature
so they contribute documentation PRs, and the Learning team works with them to polish them, flesh them out, help them get merged, and create additional, richer material as necessary.
In addition, you will
Streamline and simplify. Like code, sometimes the best documentation PRs remove more lines than they add. Especially with much of the documentation contributed by independent community efforts, it can he helpful to constantly ask if docs should be combined or culled.
Help people contribute to open source. The docs are often the easiest and most accessible way for Gatsby users to give back
and that open source is great for developers — the learning team is in a position to facilitate positive experiences.
Bring novel ideas to the table. New techniques. A great new library you’ve had your eye on. Insightful feedback on other learning and ecosystem improvements.
Share your expertise with others—internally and in the Gatsby community. As the Gatsby team grows, you’ll have mentorship opportunities as well.
Experience and skills you should have
The Learning team is composed of people with skills in multiple areas: content, development, and collaboration.

Content

A track record of producing high-quality, written technical communication. Whether produced for your personal blog, or for a company (externally or internally), you’ve spent significant amounts of time writing deeply technical material for a technologist audience. You also should enjoy writing. A big part of creating high-quality documentation is a team that takes pride in tightly crafted content. You have to care.
Ability to dive into complex problems and corpuses of text. Norris numbers apply to content, not just codebases. Writing three good paragraphs is significantly less complex than writing a comprehensive essay, which is significantly less complex than writing a five-part series, which is significantly less complex than writing a book. For this role we’re looking for demonstrated aptitude somewhere between “comprehensive essay” and “five-part series” (more is a big plus!). With that experience, you should be able to quickly assess, understand, and iterate upon aspects of our docs codebase.
Ability to adjust learning content for a specific audience or outcome. Gatsby has docs in multiple types and formats, each accommodating a different learning style or skill level.
Development

Professional experience shipping production code and solving user/customer problems. We’ll have to build for new platforms (an Electron app on the desktop!) and create materials in new formats as our ambitions and standards continue to rise.
Building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Appreciation of all of the working parts of the Web Platform would help you write better docs for people who aren’t yet familiar with Gatsby’s way of doing things.
A desire to work in the modern JavaScript ecosystem. Gatsby is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies like Node.js, GraphQL, React, webpack, and Babel.
Collaboration

Experience editing content produced by others (technical or non-technical) . Perhaps you’ve taken a bunch of assorted READMEs and crafted them into an onboarding guide. Perhaps you spontaneously take a red pen to friends’ essays or blog posts. Perhaps you notice yourself editing Google Docs sent out by colleagues to make them more clear.
Strong personal communication skills. As part of our Learning team, you’d both directly and indirectly interface with community members. Clear, friendly, and professional communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources.
Ready and willing to ask and answer questions. If you’re comfortable saying you’re unsure, asking for help, and reaching out to assist others, you’ll be an incredible addition to our team. Our team thrives because of continuous learning and a willingness to work together.
Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required
You have done public speaking, developer advocacy, or teaching. On the Gatsby learning team, we often have opportunities to present on Gatsby topics at conferences and workshops. While the opportunity to grow into this skillset will still be there, experience as a public speaker would help you ramp up faster. Experience recording development screencasts is also helpful.
You have a passion for web accessibility. As maintainers of a website framework, we have an opportunity to make the web more inclusive and accessible for everyone. Previous experience with accessible web development and content creation would help you to stand out from other candidates.
You have maintained documentation in an active repository before. Maybe you’ve helped maintain a popular open source repo, or maybe you’ve worked on internal repos that saw contributions from multiple teams. Previous experience with highly active repo workflows is a definite plus for this role.
The best parts of this job
You’ll be empowered to propose ideas for new learning content and ecosystem improvements for key learning workflows.
You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site building frameworks on the market, digging into the Gatsby’s innovatively architected docs system and codebase, using modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL.
You’ll be part of an active, open, friendly community of developers that are really excited about building high-performance, fun-to-use websites.
You’ll be working in a safe, open environment of talented engineers who have a broad range of experience.
Your role will be key to making Gatsby the next way to build on the web — and a technology that is accessible to the next billion internet users.
The worst parts of this job
As the Learning team for a fast-paced startup, we are often tasked with supporting multiple teams for product launches and events. This requires balancing priorities and working together to ensure we’re working on things that provide the most value.
In open source, you’re faced with a nonstop stream of issues and pull requests. That means you need to develop an intuition of how to prioritize tasks for Learning/Core team needs and those from the community.
When working in the open–including fielding user feedback on social media–it can sometimes be difficult to remain professional when things don’t go as planned. Gatsby team members are expected to act as bridges between communities even when it’s hard, because we’re all better off for it.
Benefits you will receive
3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement
Unlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time
Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)
Skip the commute with remote work
Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups
Stock options in a fast-growing startup
Gatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure
Our Hiring Process
Gatsby is an equal opportunity employer. We eagerly seek applicants of diverse backgrounds and hire without regard to race, color, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical abilities (or disability), age, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Cultivating inclusivity and diversity is a top priority.

Headhunters and recruitment agencies may not submit resumes/CVs through this website or directly to managers. Gatsby does not accept unsolicited headhunter and agency resumes, and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with Gatsby."

Extend our API: Our customers constantly tell us how intuitive and reliable our API is. As we make our service more sophisticated, you’ll be ensuring that customers can still quickly integrate SigOpt into their workflows. Potential projects include building new RESTful endpoints and resources that connect customer needs with the research team’s algorithms.

Build Out Web App: Another project area interns work on is our React-based interface for managing and analyzing experiments. Data visualization, user management, and experiment tracking are all critical pieces of the SigOpt solution that interns extend.

Use the Best Tools: Kubernetes, Postgres, Node, Python 3, GitHub, PagerDuty, Slack. We make sure our developers have everything they need to do their best work. You'll need to be curious, and ramp up on new tools. These skills will make you a more effective engineer long term; they are worth the effort!

Myriad Women’s Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, Ltd., a premier women’s health genetic screening and testing company to help women and their families understand their risks for inherited disease, cancer, and at-risk pregnancies.
Our tests are powered by an automated sequencing lab and software that covers the entire technology stack: automation, scientific compute, data pipelines, variant calling/interpretation (bioinformatics), data visualization, risk calculations (population genetics), electronic medical records (EMR), patient and doctor user experience (UX), and solving key workflow problems in large complex health systems.
Responsibilities
We are looking for self-motivated interns, scientists and software engineers with backgrounds in Computer Science or Computational Biology who are interested in joining our engineering and research teams to work on problems in this space.
For our interns, we pair them directly with an engineer or scientist to work on projects ranging from shipping patient facing production code to working on new early R&D genomics products.

For 2019 we will have 4-teams that will be hiring: Genomics (Curation), Genomics (Reporting), LIMS (laboratory information management system) & Bioinformatics.

Myriad Women's Health products help people make life changing decisions - we’ve revolutionized the lab and created a one of a kind platform that gives people access to critical health information at key junctures in their lives - and it all uses Python!

The vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python/Django/Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing. We're building new tools, new workflows, and new infrastructure to solve the challenging problems of a technology startup involved with not just bits, but also interconnected physical components like lab robotics and patient samples.

Don't be intimidated if you don't have a genomics background; solving these problems fundamentally requires software solutions. We're looking for the best and brightest software engineers — strong generalists with solid CS fundamentals and practical software engineering intuition — to help us scale up genomics to billions of users.

If you're interested in working with modern web technologies, brilliant engineers and products that influence millions of people’s lives, this is the place for you.

38,Software Engineer - Disclosures,"San Francisco, CA",San Francisco,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Blend makes the process of getting a loan simpler, faster, and safer. With its industry-leading digital lending platform, Blend helps financial institutions like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank increase productivity and deliver exceptional customer experiences. The company processes nearly $2 billion in loans daily, helping millions of consumers get into homes and gain access to the capital they need to lead better lives.

One of the most important parts of buying a home is viewing and signing disclosure packages. These documents explain what getting a mortgage entails. Your job would be helping to build a system to deliver these documents to borrowers. Sounds simple right? Well it turns out there it’s more involved than you would think. At a high level there are three main problems to solve in order to issue a package. First, we need to grab the latest data from all the systems we integrate with. This means we need to solve how to keep data from multiple systems in sync. Second, we need to create the package in Blend in such a way that borrower can interact with it. Lastly, we need to track when each borrower views, signs, and completes the package.
Now to make it more fun, we need to build all of the above in a way that any partner can easily plugin to our disclosures solution. These partners could be involved in any of the three problems listed above. As you can see we have a lot to do.
You may be a fit for this role if you:
Have experience building platforms and APIs for other developers to use
Enjoy building point-to-point and event based integrations
Design systems with resilience and quality top of mind
Proactively think about potential failure scenarios and how to handle them properly
Projects you could work on:
Building a disclosures platform for partners to integrate into Blend
Building one of the first e-close solutions
Helping Blend fully transition to microservices

Typescript with Node.js

About Engineering
-----------------

Our team is made up of people from varied backgrounds, including engineers who built and scaled organizations like Google, Netflix, eBay, GitHub, and LivingSocial. We build modern software with modern techniques like TDD, continuous delivery, DevOps, and service-oriented architecture. We focus on high-value products that solve clearly identified problems and are designed in a sustainable way. Some of our proudest moments come from solving business problems without writing a line of code. We cannot succeed without creative engineers!

About the Role
--------------

You will deliver products and solutions—not just features—by developing an understanding of how Stitch Fix works. We trust you to focus your time and efforts where they are needed most. Your commitment to applying technology to business challenges will make you a trusted advisor to your partners and their teams. You will own projects and influence our direction.

You won't do this alone. Your team will collaborate with business partners to define projects, plans, and deliverables. You will work with team members to take advantage of learning and growth opportunities in tech and product through real day-to-day work.

We are looking for Engineers for our Client Data Platform team:

Your cross-functional team is responsible for the data that clients share with Stitch Fix in order to understand their personal style. You will work with Data Scientists, engineering partners, and product partners to extend existing APIs and build new tools for sharing relevant information across the organization. You will collaborate with the team to write code used by many partners in service of every Stitch Fix client.

About the Technology

Technologies we rely on to pursue solutions to business problems include:


Ruby and Rails
Postgres
Redis
RabbitMQ / Messaging
ElasticSearch

Even if you already have experience with these tools, you'll have the chance to get even better with them. And if you don't already use these tools, we will help you learn and become effective with them.

You're excited about this opportunity because...


We work collaboratively as a distributed team—we are a primarily remote team and we use GitHub, Slack, and video conferencing extensively to collaborate.
You will have the opportunity to build relationships with partners across the organization to better understand the ways we use client data and gain insight into how we can develop capabilities that solve real problems.
Our workflow depends on testing and CI—we're working with the usual Ruby gems like RSpec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests and use CircleCI to bring it all together.
We have a distributed, service-oriented architecture—we're using tools like RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, and headless HTTP services to scale our team and software.

We use these tools and techniques help us get the job done and we're excited to

share our expertise with new members of the team. You will have the opportunity to help us continue to adopt effective practices and technologies and explore their full potential.

We are excited about you because...


You are enthusiastic about technology. You will collaborate to build solutions using the appropriate tools and contribute to design and architecture across multiple systems. You want to build on your experience and help us to adopt new technologies. You'll learn from us, and we'll learn from you. You care deeply about the experience you are delivering.
You have a product-focused mindset. Our team works together to deliver projects that use technology to solve real business problems. Your team members and business partners will seek out your opinion on how the product you're building should work. You aren't afraid to dig deep and ask the tough questions of our customers, company, and executive team.
You are interested in developing your leadership qualities. You should believe in what you're doing and inspire others around you to be their best selves? Do you feel ownership for the projects you are working on?
You have deep respect for your craft. We are dedicated to building software sustainably, using modern techniques. You're always looking for more and better ways to write software, and enthusiastic about sharing them with your team.
You are respectful, empathetic, and humble. We want you to take your work seriously and be open to personal and professional growth. Successful engineers show everyone respect and consideration.

You'll love working at Stitch Fix because we...

",None Found,None Found,"Hey gophers!


Loyyal is building a blockchain platform for loyalty programs and their partners. We’re currently hiring Go engineers to join us in our San Francisco office. We’re solving challenging technical problems including observability, reliability and performance of distributed networks, distributed identity management and transaction synchronization across disparate platforms. We’re looking for enthusiastic and talented engineers to join our tight-knit team to help us tackle the hard problems at the frontiers of distributed systems.

When you wake up you may have unread messages of inspiration from our early rising CEO. You can glance at them and make a mental note to revisit them in normal human hours since asynchronous communication is encouraged. You’ll arrive at the office and nod to yourself about the modern facilities and say something like “this sure beats that literal garage I worked in that one time”.

At your desk you’ll quickly craft (or remind yourself of) your objectives for the day using asynchronous goal tracking tools. Then you’ll get straight to work. At Loyyal you own your time and push forward to achieve the goals of the company that are most important at the time.

Whatever you’re doing, chances are you’re learning something new and expanding your skill set.

During the day you’ll pause every now and then to make a comment about how floral tracksuits are fresh or to share your very good idea for a new episode of Black Mirror.

At the end of every day you’ll have pushed forward the goals of the company in a concrete way. What’s more you’ll have made Loyyal’s vision of revolutionizing the loyalty industry by reducing barriers to entry and enabling novel functionality that much brighter and closer.

About the Team
--------------

Lob started 7 years ago with our print & mail API, but we kept hearing from customers that ensuring addresses are valid and actually deliverable is a huge challenge. In fact, we found that with one customer, in particular, nearly 25% of their mail was being sent to undeliverable addresses! As a result, the Address Verification API was born. We spent almost 2 years achieving what's called CASS certification by USPS which validates the accuracy of our software, and when we passed the test - they told us Lob was the first new company in nearly a decade to pass it.

Lob's Address Verification API verifies that addresses are actually deliverable TO AVOID sending mail to undeliverable addresses and cutting major costs for companies. The API ensures addresses adhere to required postal formatting and automatically corrects addresses when they are incorrectly formatted.

Growth and mentorship. We believe in growing engineers through ownership and leadership opportunities. We also believe mentors help both sides of the equation.
A stable, collaborative and supportive work environment. We work in an open environment, have a shared kitchen and sit down for a quick sync every morning.
Balance. We don't expect people to work 12 hour days. We want you to have a successful time outside of work too. Want to work from home sometimes? No problem. We trust our colleagues to be responsible with their time and commitment, and believe that balance helps cultivate a positive environment.
What you provide:
Desire to Learn and Adapt. We have a lot of projects going on at once, and you'll have to learn to navigate the code and features. You'll constantly be learning new areas and new technologies.
Passion. Our customers are passionate about Splunk and we want the same from our engineers. We want you to actively own your work and be excited about your projects.

Examples of areas you may be knowledgeable in may include multi-threaded programming, distributed file systems, distributed concurrency control, consistency models, consistent hashing, CAP theorem, multi-process execution models, good grasp of data structures and algorithms, etc. You don't need to be an expert on everything, but you should have foundation to build on.
Experience developing against relational databases. You’ll be designing systems to translate complex business logic into SQL in a latency sensitive multiple tenant environment.
Ability to work with multiple programming languages. We have code in several languages, ranging from C/C++ and Java to Python and JavaScript. In this position you'll be mostly using Java and/or C++.

The modern world runs on the Internet, and the Internet cannot exist without its underlying infrastructure. Meraki makes setting up, managing, and maintaining that infrastructure easier than it has ever been before. Meraki enables connectivity everywhere from neighborhood cafes to renowned universities to global hospitality groups operating thousands of sites.

As a Product Software Engineer at Meraki, you will bring life to our products, imbuing them with what some call the Meraki Magic. Through your contributions, you will enable our customers to do more things more easily than ever before. You will have opportunities to work across our stack, developing software ranging from bootloaders, device drivers, and routing code to our distributed, cloud-hosted backend.

Meraki believes that the quality of our product is dependent on the quality of our engineers. We place a high value on nurturing the growth and development of everyone on our team. We foster an open and supportive workplace where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed.

Here are some of the projects you might find yourself working on:


Designing and implementing (usually in C/C++) features to improve the reliability, simplicity, and performance of our devices, as well as make them more flexible and powerful
Bringing up our Linux-based system on new hardware platforms
Collaborating with our hardware engineers on the design of new platforms

You're the kind of person we're looking for if:

BA/BS in Computer Science, ECE, EE, ME or STEM related field (in progress)
You are comfortable writing systems-level C/C++ (or if you've written your own OS!)
You have familiarity developing and implementing computer networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, routing protocols, IPv6, etc.)
You have worked with Linux on embedded platforms
You have an understanding of OS fundamentals and experience working in both kernel and user space
You love being a part of a tight-knit, high-performing team and want to have an impact with your own work while also elevating your teammates
You have previous internship or large scale project experience

As a software engineer early in your career, you may still be identifying areas that you are curious about or in which would like to develop more depth. At Meraki, you will have the opportunity to explore multiple technology areas and problem domains. Whether you have a passion for user interfaces, distributed systems, network protocols, or embedded development — or perhaps more than one of these — you will be able to dive deep here. Together with your team you will craft from top to bottom the suite of innovative products that make Meraki unique.

------------------------

Intern Program Overview:
------------------------

Meraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the majority of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.

Meraki's engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life.

Founded in 2015, Instabase's mission is to advance the state of the art by building tools that help people solve important problems, make discoveries, and create new breakthroughs.

Instabase is an operating system designed for operational efficiency. It uses the web browser as the user interface, a pluggable storage system for managing data (files and databases), and an app store for applications. These applications run on the Instabase Platform, which provides the core management capabilities for managing diverse, distributed datasets; support for collaboration and access control; and a runtime for Instabase Applications.

The applications include state of the art tools for [1] processing a diverse set of unstructured data (scanned images, PDFs, word/excel documents, emails, websites, etc.), [2] running extensible functions with a server-less framework, [3] machine learning (natural language processing, image processing, classification, clustering, etc.), and [4] data science.

Our customers include large enterprises with huge operational costs in a variety of domains, such as financial services (e.g. banks, insurance), healthcare, logistics/supply chain.

As a non-profit initiative, Instabase provides a hosted IPython-style notebook for education, which is widely used by universities (Stanford, MIT, Columbia, University of Chicago, etc.), for teaching classes. The Stanford Dean of Engineering Jennifer Widom used Instabase as the platform for her 2016-17 Instructional Odyssey, a year-long sabbatical in which she traveled the world offering free short courses in data and design.

At Tempo Automation, we're modernizing the way electronics are manufactured and we are looking for the most talented, creative and passionate people to join our team! We are building sophisticated software which delivers data to and extracts data from a roboticized electronics factory and all the surrounding process, toolsets and people. We enable our customers to rapidly kick off a complex electronics build with a firm belief that they'll receive the exact build they requested as well as unique value in the form of deep insight and feedback into what actually happened during their manufacturing process, what was actually built. This allows our customers to move faster with much better comprehension of all that they do.

What you'll do...

We're looking for a Full Stack Software Engineer to join our engineering team. Our team is small, which means every team member is given a lot of responsibility and flexibility. You'll work with Engineering Managers, VPs, factory technicians, and other engineers to spec out projects. But in the end, design and execution is up to you.

Providing electrical engineers with the physical equivalent of a fast and correct compiler is extremely difficult, but the payoff is enormous. If we succeed, we will accelerate the development of dozens of critical industries. Instead of having hardware engineers sit on their hands for weeks waiting for prototypes, our platform enables rapid self-service that delivers a prototype in days.

Some of the things you might work on include:

Offering real-time, automated manufacturing feedback based on certain parameters of our customers' designs (think linting for hardware)
A rich visual flow of information throughout our internal teams and for our customers which enables both broad and focused communication in ways never seen before
Extract and transform of hyper dense electronics data from customers, our factory systems and internal toolsets into entirely new forms which enable much of the above featureset.

We're looking for someone that has…


5+ years experience with production class Python
5+ years experience with JS frameworks (we use React)
5+ years experience with web technologies in general
Experience working in cloud infrastructure (we use AWS)
Experience with relational databases (we use Postgres)
Bonus: experience with any of ourother tech ( https://stackshare.io/tempo-automation/tempo-automation )!

We provide...


Unlimited Vacation – We understand the importance of disconnecting and trust you to manage your time and get your work done. We offer salaried employees an open vacation policy.
Exceptional Benefits Package – We value healthy and happy employees. We offer a 401(k) and cover 100% of the premium for our competitive base health, dental, and vision package.
Parental Leave- We know you need time to welcome and celebrate each new addition to your family. We offer paid parental leave to make this possible.
Flexible Stock Options – We view options as real compensation, not a ball and chain. We allow employees who leave after two years of service to exercise their options for up to 7 years.
Weekly Lunches and Office Snacks – We know nothing says thank you like free food. We offer a stacked snack pantry and weekly, free company-wide lunch to fuel the journey.
San Francisco Office Location – We offer a convenient San Francisco location. Don't live in the city? We offer commuter benefits to help.
Commuter Benefits Package – However you get to work, we want to help! We offer all salaried and hourly employees a range of commuter benefits to compensate for their time on the road.
Transparent and Social Culture – We work better when we're all on the same page. We have company-wide weekly meetings to review milestones and metrics, semi-annual off sites to discuss the broader vision, and biweekly socials.

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list.

We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

About the Department

Cloudflare's Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles a large number of HTTP requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world's largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.

What you'll do

Cloudflare is looking for a backend engineer to help us build and maintain the codebase that powers both our customer APIs as well as internal service APIs. This is a role for engineers that are familiar with standard web backend architecture, and capable in database design and interaction. Our API platform is under constant load and scrutiny, so experience and commitment to easily understood and tested code is also a key part of the role. Your ability to visualize the flow of data through a complex application is critical to your success, and to the team's. You will be working closely with the product team to understand and document the functional needs of their product requirements, developing new code to solve new problems, as well as maintaining existing code to squash bugs. Our web stack is based on PHP, Redis, and Postgres, but you'll also need to consider the nature of REST APIs, database management, and deployment workflows. Knowledge of PHP is not a must, but deep familiarity with web favored languages is (Python, Ruby, Golang).

Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience


5+ years of experience building large-scale software applications
Experience designing and integrating RESTful APIs
Knowledge of SQL and common relational database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL
Excellent debugging and optimization skills
Unit/integration testing experience
Experience using backend web frameworks

Bonus Points


Familiarity with containerization development workflows
Familiarity with PostgreSQL stored procedure development

What Makes Us Special

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/ ): We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.

Project Athenian ( https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/ ): We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/ ): Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

We released1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by ourprivacy policy ( https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ ) and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!
