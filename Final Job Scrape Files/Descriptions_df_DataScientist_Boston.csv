Our tracking, fusion, and analytic algorithms go to the Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence, Surveillance, and Recognizance Systems (C4ISR) business area to improve their products that are used by military and intelligence analysts every day. Or they may go to the Electronic Combat Solutions (ECS) business area to add capability to their electronic warfare systems installed on aircraft like the F-35 or B-2.

We use data analysis to understand sensor phenomenology including biases, errors, dropouts, etc. Data analysis also informs us about how detection algorithms operate on radar, electro-optical, and signal data, etc.
Modeling and simulation enables multi-resolution modeling of complex systems: we can run a low-fidelity radar simulation on thousands of targets, or we can run a high-fidelity simulation on a smaller number of targets.
Additionally, M&S allows us to couple our data association algorithms with sensor resource managers and learning algorithms: our data association algorithms estimate the world around us, and task sensors to investigate specific entities.
Probability and statistics provide the foundation for most of our data association algorithms. We use them to formulate statistical models, perform Bayesian inference, and update our understanding of the world.
All of this is typically prototyped in a high level language like MATLAB or Python before being ported to C++, and our scientists frequently present our algorithms and results to customers and at conferences.

Other qualities are more qualitative. What are the characteristics of a beautiful balcony view and how do you work to improve it for a specific project? Why do humans find certain spaces attractive and what do you do to maximize this attractiveness? For the more subjective aspects of quality, we are constantly exploring new and innovative ways to gain insight into how these aspects can be measured and optimized to improve value creation in real estate projects.

As the problems we solve are very complex we are looking for candidates with a solid mathematical foundation and love problem solving. Our ideal candidate has a Master or PhD in Analytics, Engineering, Mathematics or a related field.

97,Senior Data Scientist,"Boston, MA",Boston,MA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"You:
You are not a traditional data scientist. You sleep, eat, and breath Excel and R, but are tired of working task lists in a slow-moving corporation. You enjoy the process of discovering new data challenges, and want the freedom to create meaningful solutions in real-time. You are constantly learning, teaching yourself new disciplines, and you are obsessed with the potential uses of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You want the autonomy and responsibility that comes with being the company’s go-to resource for all-things data.

In this role, you will translate complex business challenges into data tasks – our managers and clients know what’s wrong, and it is up to you to investigate in the data, determine the cause, and devise an elegant solution. You will continually refine your models to learn from increasing amounts of available information. You will decide what data points should be silently corrected, vs. highlighted with intuitive suggestions. This suggestion engine will be the foundation of the company’s core product.

As the quality of data improve, your role will increasingly shift towards predictive analytics – using platform data to drive the high-level business strategies of our clients.

You’ll be a skills fit if you:
have 5+ years of experience using R, Python, Excel VBA, Apache Spark, Eclipse Deeplearning4j, and similar libraries
have significant experience using AI toolkits such as TensorFlow, Pylearn2, and Pattern
have significant experience building and training models using web services such as Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson, and Google CloudVision
have experience with image recognition, and image content identification
routinely identify high-value data issues, explain their business impact to senior executives, and devise an elegant solution to the problem

You’ll be a character fit if you:
enjoy the challenges and rewards of working in a *very* early stage startup (very strong preference for someone who has worked in a <50-person company).
are constantly tinkering (we love tinkerers!).
enjoy challenging the status quo, and constantly come to your team with ideas for improvement.
know when to check in for approval vs. run with an idea.
view working for a large corporation as the death of productivity, innovation, intellectual stimulation, education, and pretty much any other goal of a company/job.
do not sit idle once a task is complete – you have a constant backlog of tasks, or things you want to learn.
have worked in a variety of team environments – distributed, remote, off-shore, near-shore, etc.
think that TCP/IP is one of the most under-appreciated accomplishments of modern computing.
want to create (and I really mean *create*) a fun, hard-working environment of peers with whom you’re excited to slay the day.
don’t get wrapped up in titles, and chip in on things that need doing without asking (even if they have absolutely nothing to do with your responsibilities).

What you get:
Outstanding benefits, including fully-paid health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, generous vacation, BYOD compensation, etc.
Flexible work environment – e.g. working from home, shifted hours, etc.
Potentially, equity shares in the company, depending on your experience
The unique experience, pride and status that comes from being one of the first employees of a software startup
The opportunity to build your own team as we expand, and shape the entire company/product
The opportunity to “do it right” this time. We have all inherited someone else’s mess at some point, and wished we could build something from scratch to meet our own impeccable standards. It’s time to seize the opportunity.
Company perks
Flexible schedule
Flexibility is key - we realize that working from home can significantly improve our team's work-life balance, so we're pleased to offer this as an option to the right individuals.
