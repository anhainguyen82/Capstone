Job Description
The Complex Systems Simulation and Optimization Group in the NREL Computational Science Center has an opening for a full-time postdoctoral researcher in artificial intelligence (AI) and stochastic optimization for energy systems, with special emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (RL) for AI control. We believe that AI-powered systems have the potential to transform our renewable energy future through advanced automation and control, and are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background to help pursue this goal.
Stochastic optimization and sequential decision problems arise in a variety of areas of renewable energy research including power system planning and management, wind farm optimization, battery management, building energy management, and transportation. At the same time, recent advances in AI (and deep RL in particular) suggest that complex decision making can be optimized via a combination of machine learning, modeling and simulation, often with clear advantages over traditional optimization-based methods. However, these ideas are only just starting to be applied to renewable energy systems and thus constitute a promising set of research directions.
The successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, improve, and scale cutting edge AI methods to real-world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with NREL staff and researchers, other national labs, and universities on efforts to develop and apply AI at scale to real-world problems in renewable energy research, with specific emphasis on modernization of the nation’s grid, building, and transportation infrastructure and operation to support the 100% renewable energy scenario. In particular, the candidate will participate in a large interdisciplinary effort to establish the foundations of so-called “autonomous energy systems”, in which quasi-independent agents interact to seamlessly integrate and control large numbers of distributed energy resources.
Responsibilities include:
Collaborate with NREL and partner researchers to develop and apply modern AI and stochastic control techniques for use in real-world energy systems. Primary challenges include identification of appropriate application areas, adaptation of methods to these areas, and scaling of methods to solve relevant problems. Key areas of study include the optimal incorporation of existing domain knowledge into AI methods, the development of scalable algorithms for continuous and/or mixed spaces, and development of hybrid methods that combine the best of both AI and classical stochastic optimization.
Evaluate and track the state of artificial intelligence and stochastic control research, especially for sequential decision problems in complex real-world spaces.
Author, present and assist in the preparation of technical papers, reports and conference proceedings on topics related to modern AI control methods and their application to energy systems.
.
Basic Qualifications
Must be a recent PhD graduate within the last three years.
.
Additional Qualifications
Preferred Qualifications
Expertise in deep reinforcement learning, including fundamental knowledge and core mathematical underpinnings of neural networks, deep understanding of Markov Decision Processes, state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and their application to continuous and/or large state-action spaces.
Expertise in stochastic optimal control, including optimization and control with and without uncertainty, dynamic programming, classical control theory, (stochastic) model predictive control, Kalman filters, scenario generation, etc.
Experience with game theory, complex systems theory, agent-based learning, and distributed optimization.
Strong background in mathematics, statistics, and probability.
Strong background in physics and engineering, esp. of power systems, grid-integrated buildings, and/or transportation systems.
Strong programming skills, especially experience using deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow) on high-performance computing/GPU platforms.
.

Please note that in order to be considered an applicant for any position at NREL you must submit an application form for each position for which you believe you are qualified. Applications are not kept on file for future positions. Please include a cover letter and resume with each position application.
