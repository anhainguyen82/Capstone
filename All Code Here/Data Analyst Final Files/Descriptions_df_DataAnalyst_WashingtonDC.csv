You are passionate about using data-driven solutions to improve social outcomes, and bring a multidisciplinary approach to doing so.

You’re not afraid of messy data -and yet you also pull the emergency stop when something looks or feels wrong.
We’re not building a team for a day—this is a project for the long haul.

Analyze healthcare claims datasets to find novel insights - and then communicate those in a way that moves the needle on people’s health outcomes.
Analyze data about how individuals use digital tools in order to make services more intuitive and engaging, and the outreach around them more relevant and effective.
Check, clean and transform incoming data for data pipelines and outreach (email, SMS, etc) campaigns.
Collaborate with engineers, data scientists, program managers and external stakeholders to troubleshoot problems and proactively create solutions.
Strive to support team excellence by developing high quality documentation.
Work both independently and as part of a team to deliver accurate products on short deadlines.
You probably have:

Proficient understanding of how to manipulate data with SQL.
Experience creating complex, repeatable data pipelines that operate on millions or billions of records

77,Public Charter School Data Analyst,"Washington, DC 20010",Washington,DC,20010,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"ABOUT THE DC PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL BOARD (DC PCSB)
Every day, we're changing the way public education operates in Washington, DC—making it better for students, families, and communities. In fact, the DC Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB) currently does that for 43,000+ public charter school students who deserve a better education and a brighter future.

This work matters.

ABOUT THE ROLE
That's where you come in. You'll be responsible for collecting, maintaining, reporting, and analyzing data for our Performance Management Framework (PMF) and the accompanying annual School Quality Reports. You'll focus on adult public charter schools, working with school leaders and school-based data managers on the PMF.
You're an essential member of the Financial and Academic Quality (FAQ) team as you prepare for meetings with DC PCSB senior staff and school leaders and developing PMF policy updates. Your analysis of adult public charter schools' academic performance for charter reviews or renewals supports the entire organization.

You're more than a data analyst; you're the one we trust to educate and support school leaders regarding DC PCSB's practices and policies. You're great with verbal and written communication, and you'll work with other Data Analysts to develop easy-to-read dashboards and visualizations to communicate school performance data to the public and school leaders.
Along with the rest of the data team, you'll continue to help move us from manual analysis towards automation to more efficiently meet the needs of our fast-paced environment. Your SQL skills will help us automate the process of moving data that feeds into our QuickBase and Looker applications, and you'll share your data visualization skills with a variety of audiences.

As our go-to person for all adult education data questions, you'll learn our internal systems and be able to make changes to the processes, provide the team and leadership with strong data analysis. You'll proactively make recommendations to improve our policies, products, and processes.

COMPETENCIES AND QUALIFICATIONS
You are detail oriented, independent, and able to develop innovative solutions to difficult problems. You're comfortable with large quantities of data and, technically speaking, you have strong SQL and Excel experience as well as an additional scripting language such as Python or R.

About USAC
Through its administration of the $10 billion Universal Service Fund (USF) programs on behalf of the FCC, USAC works to promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates and to increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the nation. Specifically, the USF programs provide funding for the expansion of telecommunications and broadband access to rural communities and health care facilities, schools and libraries across the country, and low income households. Through program administration, auditing, and outreach, USAC works with contributors, service providers, and program beneficiaries to achieve the program goals articulated by the FCC for each of these programs.
The FCC has reformed the USF to support further investment in and access to evolving broadband infrastructure, making the programs a primary vehicle to support this critical national priority. USAC, as the administrator of the USF, plays a critical role in supporting the ambitious vision to ensure that all citizens in the United States have access to high-speed broadband. The organization has approximately 500 employees with an operating budget of more than $200 million. USAC works in close partnership with the FCC and other federal and state partners to support the achievement of the USF program goals.
USAC administers the USF programs—High Cost, Lifeline, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries. USAC strives to provide efficient, responsible stewardship of the programs, a key national asset in making important telecommunications and Internet services available to consumers, health care providers, schools, and libraries throughout the United States. The program divisions are supported by additional USAC personnel in Finance, General Counsel, Information Systems, Internal Audit, the Enterprise Program Management Office and Human Resources. Consistent with FCC rules, USAC does not make policy for or interpret unclear provisions of statutes or the FCC’s rules.
Universal service is paid for by contributions from telecommunications carriers, including wireline and wireless companies, and interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol providers, including cable companies that provide voice service, based on an assessment of their interstate and international end- user revenues. These contributions are most typically passed through to consumers through a universal service fee line item on their telephone bills.
Additional information on USF programs can be found at: http://www.usac.org/about/about/who-we- are/default.aspx

The BlueLabs Government Analytics practice is at the forefront of revolutionizing the ways that citizens use and learn about government services. Our team specializes in creating personalized nudges that empower people with the information they need to take action and make informed choices. We work closely with internal government innovation groups, and build on the analytics informed feedback loops pioneered in e-commerce, advocacy, politics, and consumer finance.

You will work on a fast-paced, impact-driven project team that is charged with reinventing the ways that seniors and consumers interact with and receive information about Medicare and health insurance marketplaces, with a particular focus on creating an intuitive and proactively engaging digital experience for the next 20 million Americans who will enroll in Medicare. We know this is a big task with many facets, and we embrace nuance, inclusivity, and complexity to deliver programs that work for the diverse groups of individuals who rely on us.

What you'll do:

Develop, lead, and manage a small team of analysts building a robust, data-driven outreach program for the next generation of healthcare consumers.

Collaborate with engineers, data scientists, and external stakeholders to troubleshoot problems and proactively create solutions.

Analyze healthcare claims datasets to find novel insights - and then communicate those in a way that moves the needle on people’s health outcomes.

Create repeatable data transformations, integrating data from dozens of disparate data sources, to create a clear, unified view of Medicare or marketplace beneficiaries.

Analyze data about how individuals use digital tools in order to make services more intuitive and engaging, and the outreach around them more relevant and effective.

Work both independently and as part of a team to deliver accurate products on short deadlines.

Who you are:

You are passionate about using data-driven solutions to improve social outcomes, and bring a multidisciplinary approach to doing so.

You're excited that one day you may be identifying individuals who'd benefit from a diabetes prevention program, another day you'll be helping people displaced by a disaster find specialist care in their new location, and another you'll be improving the ways that consumers predict out-of-pocket costs.

You’re not afraid of messy data -and yet you also pull the emergency stop when something looks or feels wrong.

We’re not building a team for a day—this is a project for the long haul. More than anything else, we’re looking for people who are excited by our mission, love to create, are honest about what they know, fascinated by what they don’t, and relish the opportunity to work with people who value the same.

Preferred Experience & Background

You probably have:

Proficient understanding of how to manipulate data with SQL.

Experience going from insight to impact: Using the results of your analysis to tell a story through visualization, presentation, and writing.

Demonstrated success recruiting and training diverse, technical teams: facilitating professional development, ensuring a high-quality work product, and managing team workflows and timelines.

4+ years of work experience working with data about people.
