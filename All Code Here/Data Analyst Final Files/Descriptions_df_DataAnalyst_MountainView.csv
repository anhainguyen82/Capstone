WHY CISCO

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

As a Business Analyst Intern for Cisco you will develop creative solutions for real business challenges. You will collaborate on multi-functional projects to identify areas for improvement. You will analyze internal processes, data, and problems and identify benefits from enabling new capabilities. Ultimately you will improve how Cisco operates and how we work together.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
At Cisco you will find a diverse group of people tackling business issues. We work with multi-functional teams to facilitate new business models and process improvements. Cisco employs the best so you will be surrounded by others as ambitious and dedicated as yourself.

WHO YOU AREYou are pursuing a bachelor’s or master's degree in Business, Management, Finance, Math, Accounting, Information Systems or related fieldYou have a minimum of a 3.0 GPA or equivalentYou have excellent analytical, problem-solving and decision-making skillsYou have a high level of customer focus and service excellence as you seek practical and creative solutionsYou have strong collaboration skills with internal/external customers and multi-functional teamsYou have superb communication skills, “can do” attitude and a great teammate in global environmentYou have effective time-management skills and the ability to prioritize work assignments

WHY CISCO

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"
45,Senior Data Analyst,"Palo Alto, CA",Palo Alto,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"About Earnin:
Our financial system is fundamentally unfair for people who live paycheck to paycheck. People shouldn't have to wait weeks to get the pay they've already earned. This wait forces them to spend more than $100 billion a year on short-term credit products, late fees and overdraft fees.

Earnin helps people overcome this unfairness by giving them real-time access to their money as soon as they have worked -- without fees or interest.

Our team is bound together by a desire to level the financial playing field. Our investors, Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners and March Capital believe we will change the world.

You'll help a group of pods make product decisions by providing them with insights from our data. For success in this role, you'll need to be comfortable diving deep into the data, stepping up and owning your analysis, and communicating your insights in an accessible way. As a Senior Data Analyst, you'll also help guide the rest of the Analysts at Earnin on best practices.

This position will give you ample opportunity to use and enhance your analytics skills and be hands-on with a complex product in an interesting market. We're in the process of building out our analytics capabilities, so you'll also have a chance to shape the methods and tools that we use. Our business has interesting characteristics for analysis, e.g. lack of a fixed price or term, heavy dependency on external events and providers, and a very data-rich environment. It also has a large and direct impact on the financial lives of its users.

This role has the potential for massive impact on Earnin's growth trajectory. If you have a passion for helping people and a background in data, we want to hear from you!

What Set Us Apart:

A mission to improve the financial lives of folks who need help
Exceptional product-market fit with NPS scores in the 80s

Conduct ad hoc analysis to better understand our users, how to serve their needs and run our business more efficiently.
Create and maintain reporting for business partners.
Leverage our data to deliver insights that can help improve key KPIs
Help shape the product roadmap by evangelizing insights gained from the data

Some skills we consider critical to being a Senior Data Analyst:

ABOUT US
--------

The Primary School is expanding the boundaries of traditional education. Our holistic model weaves together education, health, and family support services to ensure underserved children have the system of care they need to lead meaningful and emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy lives. We received seed funding by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a major national philanthropy.

Our approach has three defining characteristics:

We start early. We start working with parents and enroll children into our program as early as birth to reach them at their most critical stage in development.
We work with - not around - families. We know that parents and caregivers are the most important people in a child's life. We partner with them to enhance the education and health of their children.
We integrate multiple systems to serve the whole child. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.

In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four-year-olds. We have grown to serve nearly 250 children and their families. In the fall, we will have classes for children in Pre-K3 (3 year-olds), Pre-K4 (4 year-olds), Kindergarten, 1st grade, and 2nd grade. We will continue to open a new grade every year through eighth grade.

Our ultimate goal is to create a game-changing system of care for children that can be replicated across the country. To that end, we are building a model that can be effectively implemented in diverse communities and sustained on public funding. In 2019, we plan to both expand our student and family population in East Palo Alto and pursue opening our next site in the Bay Area. It's an exciting time to join the team!

Our financial system is fundamentally unfair for people who live paycheck to paycheck. People shouldn't have to wait weeks to get the pay they've already earned. This wait forces them to spend more than $100 billion a year on short-term credit products, late fees and overdraft fees.

Earnin helps people overcome this unfairness by giving them real-time access to their money as soon as they have worked -- without fees or interest.

Our team is bound together by a desire to level the financial playing field. Our investors, Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners and March Capital believe we will change the world.

We're in the process of building out our analytics capabilities, so you'll also have a chance to shape the methods and tools that we use. Our business has interesting characteristics for analysis, e.g. lack of a fixed price or term, heavy dependency on external events and providers, and a very data-rich environment. It also has a large and direct impact on the financial lives of its users.

This role has the potential for massive impact on Earnin's growth trajectory. If you have a passion for helping people and a background in data, we want to hear from you!

180,Sr. Manager/ Principal Data Analyst - Risk,"Palo Alto, CA",Palo Alto,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"About Earnin:
Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.

About the Team:
Business decisions at Earnin rely heavily on good analysis. Autonomous, cross-functional product and operational teams (we call them ""pods"") drive these decisions on a day to day basis. You'll help a group of pods make product decisions by providing them with insights from our data. For success in this role, you'll need to be comfortable diving deep into the data, owning your analysis, and communicating your insights in an accessible way.

The Risk Pod sits at the heart of Earnin. As the owners of the core business metrics, Risk powers the financial engine that allows Earnin to constantly deliver value to our community. Our Risk team has taken a unique approach to risk management, portfolio management, and interacting with our community members.

This position will give you ample opportunity to use and enhance your analytics skills and be hands-on with a complex product in an interesting market. We're in the process of building out our analytics capabilities, so you'll also have a chance to shape the methods and tools that we use. Our business has interesting characteristics for analysis, e.g. lack of a fixed price or term, heavy dependency on external events and providers, and a very data-rich environment. It also has a large and direct impact on the financial lives of its users.

This role has the potential for massive impact on Earnin's growth trajectory. If you have a passion for helping people and a background in data, we want to hear from you!
