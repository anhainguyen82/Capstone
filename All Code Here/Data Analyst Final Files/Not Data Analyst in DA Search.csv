ABOUT US
--------

The Primary School is expanding the boundaries of traditional education. Our holistic model weaves together education, health, and family support services to ensure underserved children have the system of care they need to lead meaningful and emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy lives. We received seed funding by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a major national philanthropy.

Our approach has three defining characteristics:

We start early. We start working with parents and enroll children into our program as early as birth to reach them at their most critical stage in development.
We work with - not around - families. We know that parents and caregivers are the most important people in a child's life. We partner with them to enhance the education and health of their children.
We integrate multiple systems to serve the whole child. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.

In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four-year-olds. We have grown to serve nearly 250 children and their families. In the fall, we will have classes for children in Pre-K3 (3 year-olds), Pre-K4 (4 year-olds), Kindergarten, 1st grade, and 2nd grade. We will continue to open a new grade every year through eighth grade.

Our ultimate goal is to create a game-changing system of care for children that can be replicated across the country. To that end, we are building a model that can be effectively implemented in diverse communities and sustained on public funding. In 2019, we plan to both expand our student and family population in East Palo Alto and pursue opening our next site in the Bay Area. It's an exciting time to join the team!

Crowe uses its deep industry expertise to provide audit services to public and private entities while also helping clients reach their goals with tax, advisory, risk and performance services. Crowe is recognized by many organizations as one of the country's best places to work. Crowe serves clients worldwide as an independent member of Crowe Global, one of the largest global accounting networks in the world. The network consists of more than 200 independent accounting and advisory services firms in more than 130 countries around the world.

Visit Crowe.com and find out what it's like to work at one of the “50 Best Workplaces for New College Graduates.” Crowe ranked seventh on this Fortune list, in addition to being named one of Fortune’s “Top 100 Best Companies to Work For” and among Fortune’s “20 Best Workplaces in Consulting & Professional Services”. In these surveys, Crowe personnel attribute the following policies to making Crowe a great place to work:

Innovation: Each year, Crowe invests about two percent of firm revenue in new product development funding to develop ideas brought forward by its people. Building upon a foundation of deep industry specialization, Crowe professionals follow a detailed innovation road map to create original, practical solutions that help address their clients’ biggest challenges. This process allows them to see their ideas through from start to finish.

Mobility strategy: Rolled out more than two years ago, this strategy defied the norm of the professional services industry. It allows Crowe personnel to work where they’re most productive – whether that be the office, their home or elsewhere – and wear jeans while they’re in the office. This policy continues to receive great reviews on annual internal employee engagement surveys.

Benefits: The firm promotes healthy living through its internal well-being portal, which allows Crowe individuals to complete wellness activities – such as exercise challenges, healthy eating, doctor visits and mindful lifestyle changes – for gift cards and health insurance premium reductions. Additionally, on top of its healthcare and retirement programs, Crowe recently expanded its paid time off policies for military leave and all new parents.

Community service: Recently acknowledged in the Fortune Best Workplaces for Giving Back list, the firm places a high priority on community service. In honor of the firm’s 75th year, Crowe personnel not only achieved, but surpassed their goal of 75,000 hours of volunteering. We're proud to announce that we volunteered 82,000 hours – giving back to the communities where we live and work. That’s the equivalent of 39 full-time employees at the nonprofits we served! In addition, Crowe has policies in place to align its charitable contributions with the volunteer efforts of its people.

One of the best ways to learn the about the work in policies, programs and services around for people experiencing homelessness is through an internship program. LAHSA is looking for bright, self-motivated, energetic individuals who are interested in learning the dynamics of working in a government agency. Through this program, students are involved in meaningful, productive work while energizing our organization with fresh ideas. While students can gain credit hours to apply towards their education and licensing, internships are also a great recruiting tool that allows LAHSA to train potential future employees.

Our internship program runs year-round depending upon availability of projects, resources and need. Both paid and un-paid internships are available. Paid internships will be advertised and recruited individually, with scope and stipend listed within the employment classification.

LAHSA strives to keep the local community connected with the work taking place throughout the continuum. This is accomplished through community-based events, policy advocacy, correspondence and everyday involvement with the Los Angeles Continuum of Care (CoC). As an intern you may provide support to staff with special events, policy and research, program design, homeless programs and services, and special projects related to the mission of reducing homelessness. The goal is to establish a workable and mutually beneficial learning environment.

The internship program is designed to help students develop knowledge and understanding of the common principles, functions and practices related to working in a public agency. Although unpaid, interns receive important benefits like working directly with staff, elected officials, and community leaders on issues and events related homelessness in additional to gaining valuable skills and experience in the professional work environment. Interns may also qualify for educational credit from their college or university.

4,SOFTWARE ENGINEER,"Seattle, WA",Seattle,WA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Notes: As a UW employee, you will enjoy generous benefits and work/life programs. For detailed information on Benefits for this position, click here.


As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.


UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.


The Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine (BBI) is a recently launched, joint venture of the University of Washington, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle Children’s Hospital, made possible by a $50 million gift from the Brotman and Baty Families. The BBI Advanced Technology Lab is a new entity within this institute tasked with making cutting-edge ‘-omics’ technologies broadly available to the Institute’s research community. Through the BBI Advanced Technology Lab, the institute will have the capacity to generate transcriptomic profiles from at least 10 million single cells across 30 investigator-initiated projects from all three institutions. We will soon start operating as a cost center, taking on projects first from BBI members followed by an expansion to the wider research community.


The Department of Genome Sciences currently has an outstanding opportunity for a SOFTWARE ENGINEER.


Position purpose:

The purpose of the BAT-lab Analysis Team is to train BBI member labs in currently available single cell informatics in order to glean biological insights from the data generated by the BAT-lab. In addition, the team will continue to develop novel algorithms to integrate and visualize data across projects, tissues, time courses, etc. The BBI anticipates the capacity to generate additional datasets including single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling and co-assays as appropriate for specific projects. As a Lead Single Cell Genomic Data Analyst for BAT-lab Analysis team the candidate would be responsible for:


Software Engineering and Data Analysis: 85%

Optimizing and maintaining the data processing pipeline (either in the cloud or on UW Genome Sciences servers) that will mesh with BAT-lab sample tracking.

Developing analytic and/or visualization tools for a cohesive single cell atlas.

Managing a junior analyst.

Holding office hours with individual single cell collaborators to guide data analyses.

Holding video or in-person training workshops to teach collaborators how to use single cell analysis software tools. (i.e. Developing workshops for the BBI Single Cell Symposia and smaller training sessions).

Use BAT-lab project management tools.

Be open to the eventual management of more employees.

Attend conferences to keep up with the field.


Lab Meetings: 10%

Attend Trapnell and/or Shendure lab meetings and BAT-lab huddles.


Publications: 5%

Even though the BATLab Platform is a service, any BBI collaborative project with excessive hand-holding for data analysis will include the software engineer as an author. The software engineer’s contributions will be recognized not only in Seattle by the BBI community but nationally and internationally, as he/she will have ample opportunities to lead publications describing new data analysis or visualization tools as well as to attend/present at conferences. We anticipate this role has growth potential analogous to that of Institute Scientists at the Broad Institute many of whom are well recognized leaders in their field.

You would communicate results and progress directly to Dr. Lea Starita and Dr. Jay Shendure. You would participate in Shendure and Trapnell lab meetings to help maintain communications between the BAT-lab and their groups. The software engineer will also communicate with Dr. Cole Trapnell regarding new analyses and pipeline work. The software engineer will spend time at UW in the H-wing to work with the BAT-lab, Genome Sciences for lab meetings, and hold office hours at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and Fred Hutch.

As an early member of the BAT-lab, you will have the opportunity to shape that lab’s organization and culture, as well as that of the BBI more generally. The BAT-lab has a large budget and broad institutional support which will help us achieve maximum success. We expect that the single cell projects and your contributions will be recognized not only in Seattle by the BBI community but nationally and internationally.


Minimum requirements:

Ph.D. in genomics, computational biology, or related field.

At least four years relevant experience in software development for genomics.

Candidate should have outstanding academic and professional track record.

Candidate should be an analytical thinker with outstanding interpersonal and communication skills. Must be highly disciplined and organized.

Candidate should be enthusiastic about outreach to the local research community

Successful candidate will be highly self-motivated and eager to a hands-on approach to collaborative scientific discovery efforts.


Preferred qualifications:

Expert R and/or Python programming skills – ideally both

Experience with pipeline development tools like Nextflow or Snakemake

Experience with cluster use (Sun Grid Engine or similar)


Application Process:

The application process for UW positions may include completion of a variety of online assessments to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation process. These assessments may include Work Authorization, Cover Letter and/or others. Any assessments that you need to complete will appear on your screen as soon as you select “Apply to this position”. Once you begin an assessment, it must be completed at that time; if you do not complete the assessment you will be prompted to do so the next time you access your “My Jobs” page.
