About the Job
The Lowell Emergency Services Program (ESP) through Lahey Health Behavioral Services has been awarded a grant by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation to expand access to Behavioral Health services in an Urgent Care Capacity where the Lowell ESP has identified an urgency to provide open access to client’s who are in need of medication management as there are lengthy wait lists and a shortage of psychiatrists within the Lowell area and its surrounding towns.
As a result, the Lahey Lowell ESP will be implementing telepsychiatry as a bridge service available to individuals aged 21+ who have completed a crisis evaluation with an identified urgent need to access medication at the completion of their evaluation to reduce psychiatric symptoms causing impairment to the client’s current level of functioning.
Lahey seeks to hire an IT Data Analyst who can support the creation, modification and delivery of data reports pertaining to clients who participate in crisis evaluations along with those who are utilizing telepsychiatry as a support.

Currently, Key Autism Services provides services to children and adults diagnosed with autism throughout the states of Georgia and Massachusetts. Services include programs for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD and other related mental health and developmental conditions. We have been serving families since 2014. At Key we work as compassionate partners with individuals, families, case managers and other professionals to provide the level of support needed to improve the lives of the clients and families we serve.

At Key, all of the professional services we provide are guided by a common philosophy about the role of the family in a child's development. We strive to equip both the children and their families with necessary skills for strong, satisfying relationships with one another, because we know that learning happens best when it happens in the context of playful, reciprocal interactions with life partners.

We believe family is the foundation for a child's development. Family is the ever-present guiding force in a child's life from the first breath through childhood, adolescent, and adult years. Family doesn't close for the holidays, go on vacation or call it quits at five o'clock. Family remains a persistent presence on a day-in, day-out basis, through all the seasons of the year, through all the years in a lifetime.

Our team is committed to helping individuals and their families become self-sufficient and live as independently as their abilities allow. We hire compassionate, highly trained, and dedicated BCBAs who show a passion to contribute their skills to make our clients more successful, more passionate and active in their plan of care, and more independent in their life.
