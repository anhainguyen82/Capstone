The initial appointment is expected to be three years with consideration for renewal. We are looking for an experienced practitioner and scholar in Data Stewardship who can demonstrate an in-depth understanding of data curation, data documentation and data preservation, specifically: • Current best practices and policy surrounding active data management through the data lifecycle, including data collection, data management plans, data storage, data quality and reproducibility • Experience of handling research data including application of date standards and formats, data description and documentation, metadata schema for disciplinary data, data citation and persistent identifiers, data publication, data analysis, data visualization, data re-use and metrics • Contemporary good practice in data selection and appraisal, data infrastructure including data repository software platforms, and long-term data preservation strategies • An awareness of diverse disciplinary data practices, research workflows and workflow platforms, as well as an in-depth knowledge of particular domain(s).

Adopting a translational perspective will enable iSchools to supply and deploy data talent and data products more rapidly to the range of consumers, where there Is currently an acknowledged workforce need\". Development of the Data Stewardship Pathway has been further informed by the results of two small-scale studies, which featured an analysis of requirements for real-world positions in each of the six data science roles (data archivist, data librarian, data steward/ curator, data analyst, data engineer and data journalist) and which highlighted the knowledge, skills and competencies being sought by employers (Lyon, Mattern, Acker &amp; Langmead 2016; Lyon &amp; Mattern 2016). We expect candidates for this position to possess strong experience within the broader data community or in professional data curation environments and to have excellent interpersonal, communication and team skills. The new faculty member is expected to be able to liaise and collaborate with disciplinary faculty and researchers across a range of Schools ahd Departments in the University, but also with the regional, national and international data community. The University is actively addressing the development and adoption of research data management infrastructure, working through the Data Management Committee and administration support services on campus. The successful candidate will contribute to the Data Stewardship Pathway through both research and teaching undergrad and post-graduate students, and will be expected to demonstrate an awareness of current data developments, trends, challenges, emerging fields and a positive commitment to research. As the School offers an online degree program in addition to oncampus programs:, candidates with complementary expertise and experience\\n\\nCandidates applying for the position(s) are expected to hold an earned Doctorate or the equivalent in academic or professional experience.
