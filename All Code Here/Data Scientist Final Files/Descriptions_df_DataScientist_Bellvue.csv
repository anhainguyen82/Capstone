Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.
The Innovation Laboratory (iLab) at Fred Hutch is seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist. The iLab is a new collaborative initiative of the Immunotherapy and Translational Data Science Integrated Research Centers (IIRC and TDS_IRC) with a mission to advance the introduction and development of new immuno-oncology research technologies. The iLab will spur in-house development and early adoption of novel techniques, including advanced single cell RNA spatial sequencing, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing, and other DNA/RNA-based technologies. The data scientist will work closely with lab personnel and immunotherapy researchers to develop data analysis methods for new technologies.
Over the past three years, Fred Hutch has launched three Integrated Research Centers (IRCs) to increase collaborative research across the Center and stimulate transformative cancer discovery. The IIRC, led by Dr. Stanley Riddell, and the TDS_IRC, led by Dr. Raphael Gottardo, have joined together and created the iLab to speed adoption of novel technologies, particularly those that generate large datasets of high utility to immunotherapy. The successful candidate will be embedded in the iLab, but will also have close ties to the Gottardo Lab and the TDS_IRC. The iLab will initially be housed in the Bielas Lab. Working closely with Drs. Bielas and Gottardo, the successful candidate will function with a high degree of independence as they manage daily activities. We see the integration of computational work within the iLab as an integral part of its success, providing computational innovation.
As a Fred Hutch strategic initiative, we value inclusion and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to inform our work. We believe in supporting each other through mentorship and providing resources for professional development. Given these values, we strive to make our recruitment and promotion processes fair and transparent. Therefore, we strongly encourage all individuals with an interest in the position to apply. To learn more about the IRCs: Immunotherapy ; Translational Data Science
We are seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist to work with the iLab to develop workflows and data analysis pipelines, from novel genomics technologies developed in-house to collaboration with select industry partners. The data scientist may also support some projects more broadly, creating workflows and analyses that also include data sets generated outside of the iLab, clinical data, and other translation data sources. The ideal candidate will support large collaborative projects in a wide range of problems in oncology research and serve as a consultant/link between the iLab, laboratory and clinical scientists. The incumbent will collaborate with laboratory-based scientists, clinical investigators, biostatisticians, data scientists, programmers and computational biologists in two ways:
As member of the iLab, creating novel workflows and data analysis pipelines for novel technologies being tested and developed in the laboratory.
As a contributing member on teams using novel technologies in the iLab, creating and using computational tools for analyzing clinical and pre-clinical samples.
Through these multi-disciplinary collaborations, the data scientist will support and expand opportunities to apply novel tools and technologies to innovative pre-clinical and clinical studies.

In addition to building data tables, modeling and technical skills, you will possess strong written and verbal communication skills, strong focus on internal customers and professional demeanor and high intellectual curiosity with ability to learn new concepts and frameworks, algorithms and technology rapidly as changes arise.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of our global retail business) and employ Bigdata techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within the Our marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest Bigdata streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

Instead, we take that upon ourselves by quickly preparing these homes for the market and re-selling them. This is a key initiative at Zillow as we aim to define the future of real estate.

Our team is tasked with absorbing dozens, sometimes billions, of rows of data from various sources, organizing them, analyzing them, and visualizing them to help inform both short- and long-term decision-making.

Tell a clear story, highlight insights we hadn't previously seen, and do it all faster than we've been able to previously.
Figure out what's important to the business, to specific partners, and intuit core needs from people before they even realize they need it.
Develop a common language and approach to analyzing and communicating information and insights across teams.
Create, maintain, and document a robust set of metrics to monitor day-to-day bug detection and long-term performance tracking.
Who you are

169,Business Intelligence Engineer,"Seattle, WA",Seattle,WA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"We are looking for a Business Intelligence Engineer (BIE) with strong analytical, communication and project management skills to join our team. Working closely with business stakeholders and senior leadership, you will help identify and solve complex language and currency problems and develop metrics and reports to measure our impact on our client’s business. In a typical day, you will work closely with the product management team, retail teams, machine-learning scientists, statisticians, software engineers, and various business groups.

About you:
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.

You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the our Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

About us together:
We're going to change the way that we think about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal candidate for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment, strong data mining and modeling skills and is comfortable facilitating ideation and working from concept through to execution. You will have demonstrated an ability to manage and develop medium to large-scale data tables, identify requirements and build financial reporting and planning models and tools that are statistically grounded but also explainable operationally, apply technical skills allowing the models to adapt to changing attributes, optimize forecast accuracy and to better understand and mitigate model variance drivers. In addition to building data tables, modeling and technical skills, you will possess strong written and verbal communication skills, strong focus on internal customers and professional demeanor and high intellectual curiosity with ability to learn new concepts and frameworks, algorithms and technology rapidly as changes arise.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of our global retail business) and employ Bigdata techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within our marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest Bigdata streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

Questions?
You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.

The mission of the Systems Intelligence team is to provide situational awareness to Amazon’s leaders enabling them to make decisions that will directly impact the culture of software development. A Sr. Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Sr. Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations.
As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance. While business intelligence tends to be structured, data science leans more toward the unstructured. You must deal with incomplete, messy, unorganized data, not immediately usable without some degree of cleaning and prepping. You will generate predictive insights and new product innovations by applying advanced analytical tools and algorithms utilizing advanced statistical packages, SQL, Hadoop, and open source tools like Python and Perl.

In 2019, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.
