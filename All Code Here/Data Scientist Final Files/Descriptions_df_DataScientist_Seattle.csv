Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.

Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology (BBE) at Fred Hutch is seeking an experienced Data Scientist to work on multiple projects investigating the immunological correlates of vaccine protection for novel tuberculosis and HIV vaccine candidates. The immune response to a vaccine can be highly variable across individuals, particularly for new vaccines that are in active development. Understanding the factors that impact vaccine response and identifying the features of the immune response that confer protection can provide critical feedback for vaccine refinement. As part of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network supported by the NIH Division of AIDS and the Global Health Vaccine Accelerator Program, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation we are leading major computational efforts to integrate immunological datasets generated from human vaccine trials. Analysis datasets include those generated by multicolor flow cytometry, transcriptomics/RNAseq, T cell receptor repertoire sequencing, mass spectrometry, microbiome 16S and metagenomic sequencing, and multiplexed systems serology among others.

Figure out what's important to the business, to specific partners, and intuit core needs from people before they even realize they need it.
Develop a common language and approach to analyzing and communicating information and insights across teams.
Create, maintain, and document a robust set of metrics to monitor day-to-day bug detection and long-term performance tracking.

In particular, using our unparalleled data, and view into housing markets, to help build a world-class platform for real estate marketplace optimization. In the Zillow Offers product, Zillow buys homes directly from interested homeowners, thereby sparing them the tremendous stress and effort of selling. Instead, we take that upon ourselves by quickly preparing these homes for the market and sell them to buyers. This is a key initiative at Zillow as we aim to define the future of real estate. This product isn’t viable for everyone (yet). When that’s the case, we want to make sure we still help consumers sell their home.
Our team is tasked with absorbing dozens, sometimes billions, of rows of data from various sources, organizing them, analyzing them, and visualizing them to help inform both short- and long-term decision-making. Our structure is very flat and you will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership. Each team member focuses on a cross-section of the Zillow Offers organization.
About the role
Once you are here, you'll work to make important, strategic decisions that influence the direction of the company. More specifically:
You will dive into Zillow's internal and third party data (think Hive, Presto, SQL Server, Redshift, Python, Mode Analytics, Tableau, R) to make strategic recommendations (e.g., personalized user flows, segmented marketing audiences, more accurate pricing forecasts).
You will lead analytical efforts to develop scalable and methodologically rigorous approaches to performance measurement (e.g., AB testing, incrementality testing), forecasting, and other applications of advanced analytics.
You will serve as a mentor to other Data Scientists on the team and Analysts across the company by leading learning academies and serving as an available resource for all things related to analytics.
You will mature a common language and approach to analyzing and communicating information and insights across teams.
You will tell stories that describe analytical results and insights in meetings of all sizes with diverse audiences.
You will provide thought leadership across a variety of technical and non-technical audiences to ensure that all levels of Zillow Group make decision with an analytical foundation.
Who you are
You will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty. You will develop a deep understanding of our mission, business models, and personas. We want you to use that intuition you've developed (both in business and real life) to find opportunities for growth and cultivate insights from our massive data sets. We're looking for a seasoned data scientist. We expect:
You have an undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. science, engineering, economics, finance, statistics, or similar).
You have 2+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and complex problem solving.
You have complete command of SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau and/or Mode.
You have extensive experience directly querying multi-terabyte-sized data sets (with Hive and Presto) including clickstream data (like Google Analytics), third party data (like Facebook) and raw data ingested from non-standard platforms.
You have practice with terminology, and measurement issues related to experimentation, along with a history of applying advanced analytical approaches to derive insights from the data.
You have strong written, verbal, and visual communication skills to concisely communicate in a way that provides context, offers insights, and minimizes misinterpretation.
You have the skills to work cross-functionally and push business partners to focus on realistic goals and projects.

Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun.
Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today.
Our team is building the Map Perception component of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK, with the goal to build a scalable crowd-sourced mapping platform for autonomous driving, that will enable a fleet of autonomous vehicles to create and consume map data collaboratively.
We are seeking software engineers with interests in computer vision, mapping, LiDAR perception, deep learning, sensor fusion, and other related areas, to work as part of NVIDIA’s autonomous vehicles team.

Developing and optimizing software architecture for real-world performance while matching or exceeding customer requirements.
Working on areas such as sensor self-calibration, vehicle ego-motion, perception, mapping and localization using a variety of sensor modalities (Camera, LiDAR, Radar, INS, GPS, Odometry, etc.).
Collecting map data, working on storage systems, fusing and mining data, integrating into a cloud-based service.
Solidifying existing algorithms, and working with large amounts of real and synthetic data to continuously improve the algorithmic and computational performance.
Performing in-vehicle tests, capturing data and completing autonomous drive missions.
Developing unit tests, documentation for features, evaluating quality and proposing corrective actions.
Developing highly efficient product code in C++, making use of high algorithmic parallelism offered by GPGPU programming (CUDA). Code written must comply to strict quality and safety standards such as defined by MISRA.
What We Need To See:
Currently pursuing a MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Robotics, or related field.
To be successful you should have experience in one or more of the following areas: Computer vision, visual geometry, LIDAR perception, SLAM and/or deep learning.
Experience building robust software.
Have strong programming and debugging skills in C++ and real-time multi-threaded software development.
Good communications and analytical skills. Ability to work with multiple multi-functional teams across multiple time zones.
Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd:
Experience developing real-time LIDAR Perception and/or Computer Vision systems and / or scalable cloud based mapping solutions.
Experience fusing data from different sensor modalities (e.g. Images and LIDAR data) to enable information conflation, label propagation, cross training for deep learning.
Experience with visual geometry and deep learning in a shipping product context.
Software development on embedded platforms or large scale cloud services.
Experience with GPGPU programming (CUDA and OpenCL).
We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents are responsible for ~1.25 million deaths per year world-wide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team.

The mission of the Systems Intelligence team is to provide situational awareness to Amazon’s leaders enabling them to make decisions that will directly impact the culture of software development. A Sr. Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Sr. Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations.
As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance. While business intelligence tends to be structured, data science leans more toward the unstructured. You must deal with incomplete, messy, unorganized data, not immediately usable without some degree of cleaning and prepping. You will generate predictive insights and new product innovations by applying advanced analytical tools and algorithms utilizing advanced statistical packages, SQL, Hadoop, and open source tools like Python and Perl.

In 2019, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.
