That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE

We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").

Come work with us!

The opportunity


Are you tired of spending all your time data cleaning or churning out standard reports? Or are you working on data science problems but worried that your solutions may never be productionized? Perhaps you've just been thinking that there must be a new and exciting way for you to apply your technical skills to make a big and positive impact. If you are keen to accelerate your career in data science and start working on unsolved, intellectually challenging business problems, then look no further.


FAQ


What will I be doing as a data scientist at Quantium?


Many, many things! Your role will likely change and grow as we continue to grow, and we wouldn't want you to feel pigeon-holed either. As a quick overview for now - you will be working in a team to develop end-to-end data science solutions for our clients, deploying complex models and decision-making engines into their everyday business processes. The current opportunity is working with a very large North American retailer with some of the biggest datasets in the industry. Our projects have included optimization of marketing and personalization, inventory forecasting, complex pricing, range / assortment and more.


What tools will I be using?


Keeping in mind that we always ensure the tools we are using are fit for purpose, for our current projects, we are typically using Spark / Scala or Teradata for data preparation and Spark / Scala, R and Python for advanced analytics.


Why should I be excited about this opportunity?
With our Americas team being established a little over two and a half years ago, this is a unique opportunity to join an exciting, high growth environment where each person can contribute in their own unique way and have a big impact on the success of the team, whilst knowing that you have global capability (proven products and solutions built over 17 years!) to back you.


What is the team culture like?
We are a team of diverse and fun data scientists, consultants and sales professionals working in an environment where colleagues quickly become friends. Working in small, cross-functional project teams, you will have lots of opportunity to learn from senior leaders and share your learning with the team too. When we are not working on tough, technical problems, you might find us winding down with a drink in hand in one of our coworking offices (currently based in Bentonville, San Francisco and Chicago).


You've mentioned consulting work. Tell me more about the travel requirements.


Our team is committed to growing trusted relationships with our clients, as such, you will be traveling for up to 80% of your time to work onsite at client offices with our current opportunity in Bentonville, Arkansas. And for those who want to make the most of the outdoor activities, growing arts scene and fresh cuisine that Bentonville has to offer, we can also provide support for relocation.


OK, this is all sounding great. But do you have a bullet point list so I can see if I meet the requirements of this opportunity?
We know people are not bullet points but here we go:


Approximately 2+ years of hands-on experience in a highly technical analytics environment, carrying out data science work with large, complex datasets. Bonus points for consulting and retail industry experience.
You should ideally have experience in building models end-to-end (at least a handful through to production in a commercial environment), using techniques such as GBM/XG Boost, GLM (logistic regression), Clustering, Neural nets/deep Learning /deep nets, Multivariate regression etc
A degree in a quantitative discipline e.g. actuarial studies, mathematics / statistics, engineering etc
Experience in using at least one of Spark / Scala, Python or R and the desire to learn new languages and techniques
Ideally you will have experience working closely with business stakeholders or clients, partnering with them to deliver end-to-end project solutions. The ability to clearly communicate technical concepts to a non-technical audience is key


What else can I look forward to?


Flights, accommodation and a food allowance for work travel
Medical, dental, vision and life insurance coverage
Flexible spending account
Commuter tax benefit (in Chicago)
Retirement 401(k) plan with 6% employer contribution
Annual bonus scheme
Annual company overnight trip and plenty of other team events

Position Description


This is an exciting opportunity to work on applying Machine Learning (ML) for extreme scale simulations of high Reynolds number turbulent flows on Aurora — the first exa-scale computing platform in the United States. The extreme levels of parallelism available on Aurora create unique optimization challenges for both the CFD solver as well as the ML layer that will be used to learn and develop sub-grid models for turbulence simulations using Hybrid RANS/LES techniques. This research had the potential to revolutionize the development of sub-grid models for high Reynolds number separated flows.
