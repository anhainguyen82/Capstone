We believe that AI-powered systems have the potential to transform our renewable energy future through advanced automation and control, and are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background to help pursue this goal.\\nStochastic optimization and sequential decision problems arise in a variety of areas of renewable energy research including power system planning and management, wind farm optimization, battery management, building energy management, and transportation. At the same time, recent advances in AI (and deep RL in particular) suggest that complex decision making can be optimized via a combination of machine learning, modeling and simulation, often with clear advantages over traditional optimization-based methods. However, these ideas are only just starting to be applied to renewable energy systems and thus constitute a promising set of research directions.\\nThe successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, improve, and scale cutting edge AI methods to real-world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with NREL staff and researchers, other national labs, and universities on efforts to develop and apply AI at scale to real-world problems in renewable energy research, with specific emphasis on modernization of the nation’s grid, building, and transportation infrastructure and operation to support the 100% renewable energy scenario. In particular, the candidate will participate in a large interdisciplinary effort to establish the foundations of so-called “autonomous energy systems”, in which quasi-independent agents interact to seamlessly integrate and control large numbers of distributed energy resources.\\nResponsibilities include:\\nCollaborate with NREL and partner researchers to develop and apply modern AI and stochastic control techniques for use in real-world energy systems. Primary challenges include identification of appropriate application areas, adaptation of methods to these areas, and scaling of methods to solve relevant problems. Key areas of study include the optimal incorporation of existing domain knowledge into AI methods, the development of scalable algorithms for continuous and/or mixed spaces, and development of hybrid methods that combine the best of both AI and classical stochastic optimization.\\nEvaluate and track the state of artificial intelligence and stochastic control research, especially for sequential decision problems in complex real-world spaces.\\nAuthor, present and assist in the preparation of technical papers, reports and conference proceedings on topics related to modern AI control methods and their application to energy systems.\\n.\\nBasic Qualifications\\nMust be a recent PhD graduate within the last three years.\\n.\\nAdditional Qualifications\\nPreferred Qualifications\\nExpertise in deep reinforcement learning, including fundamental knowledge and core mathematical underpinnings of neural networks, deep understanding of Markov Decision Processes, state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and their application to continuous and/or large state-action spaces.\\nExpertise in stochastic optimal control, including optimization and control with and without uncertainty, dynamic programming, classical control theory, (stochastic) model predictive control, Kalman filters, scenario generation, etc.\\nExperience with game theory, complex systems theory, agent-based learning, and distributed optimization.\\nStrong background in mathematics, statistics, and probability.\\nStrong background in physics and engineering, esp. of power systems, grid-integrated buildings, and/or transportation systems.\\nStrong programming skills, especially experience using deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow) on high-performance computing/GPU platforms.\\n.\\nSubmission Guidelines\\nPlease note that in order to be considered an applicant for any position at NREL you must submit an application form for each position for which you believe you are qualified. Applications are not kept on file for future positions. Please include a cover letter and resume with each position application.\\n.\\nEEO Policy\\nNREL is dedicated to the principles of equal employment opportunity. NREL promotes a work environment that does not discriminate against workers or job applicants and prohibits unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, marital status, ancestry, actual or perceived sexual orientation, or veteran status, including special disabled veterans.\\nNREL validates right to work using E-Verify.
