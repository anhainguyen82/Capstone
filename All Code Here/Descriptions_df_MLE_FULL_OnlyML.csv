30,DATA SCIENTIST / MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER,"Pittsburgh, PA",Pittsburgh,PA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"COMPANY VISION
The world has seen tremendous growth in products that combine data from embedded sensors to perform intelligent functions. This functionality has enabled us to interface more naturally with our devices and has also improved our lives by alerting us to dangers or maintenance needs (e.g. biosensors, alarms, equipment condition monitoring). While enhancing the user-experience, these always-sensing products are also a major contributor to ""big data"" as they improve the way we exercise, communicate, secure our homes, monitor our health, and maintain our equipment. One of the big challenges device manufacturers face is to meet the market demand for untethered always-sensing products by porting this always-sensing functionality from corded products to battery-operated products without sacrificing sensing capabilities and maintaining reasonable battery-life and keeping data to a manageable level.
Aspinity's unique analog processor marks a paradigm shift in the way data is collected. Just as the brain makes sense of its multi-modal sensory input by focusing higher-order cognition on salient characteristics, Aspinity enables developers to extract ""sense"" from sensors before the data is even digitized, which reduces power consumption and allows the system to focus compute resources on relevant information. With already established applications to voice control, sound classification, machinery monitoring, and distributed power grid monitoring, Aspinity's programmable analog processing technology is positioned to be the key abstraction layer for the physical world at a time when new user interface paradigms (touch to voice to …) and new monitoring capabilities are transforming industries. Join us as we build a new sensing framework!
POSITION DESCRIPTION
Aspinity is looking for an experienced data scientist to support optimization of algorithms and architectures for Aspinity's revolutionary analog processor solution. You will be responsible to create training frameworks for end-customers and tools for internal product optimization.

Improve training algorithms that target unique analog processor solution
Develop tools for analyzing results of hardware model experiments on large datasets to support performance optimization
Develop tools for system-level optimization of analog/digital/cloud partitioning to minimize overall power consumption
Develop and test signal processing libraries and applications for RAMP IC
Collect and analyze IC resource utilization in delivered algorithms to support IC architecture optimization
Interface with customers/partners to support system optimization with 3rd party data
Be ""voice of customer"" on SDK requirements and contribute to SDK development
REQUIREMENTS:
MSEE/CPE/CS degree with ~5 years of relevant industry experience in data science, machine learning, and signal processing
Expert in Python/Octave/Matlab/R with experience in applied ML, ML theory, large datasets, real-world sensor data
Experience with signal processing—including machine learning, signal detection, and optimization techniques; Experience with analog signal processing is a plus
Experience in one or more of the following sensor application areas: audio/voice, vibration monitoring, touch/proximity, biosensing, electric/magnetic fields
Strong problem-solving skills and experience working in a fast-paced collaborative environment; Able to adapt to change quickly and effectively—including prioritizing tasks
Strong on attention to detail and making sure issues and tasks get followed through to completion

Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company tackling the challenges of urban growth. Our vision for cities is rooted in a cross-disciplinary approach that is reflected in our team, composed of experts from real estate, government, finance, technology, engineering and more. Since its founding in 2015, Sidewalk Labs has evolved into an organization of over 100 employees based primarily in New York and Toronto.

We are currently designing a new kind of mixed-use, complete community on Toronto's waterfront in partnership with the tripartite agency Waterfront Toronto and the local community. This joint effort, called Sidewalk Toronto, will combine forward-thinking urban design and new digital technology to create a people-centered neighborhood that achieves precedent-setting levels of sustainability, affordability, mobility, and economic opportunity.

We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it.

What is the role?

To improve sustainability in cities, Sidewalk Labs is developing new technology that will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to the status quo, empower smarter management of resources, and reduce the cost of future upgrades and maintenance. We plan for a 75%-85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to similar projects, aiming for Climate Positive.

To achieve our sustainability goals in Quayside, we plan to pilot and scale different kinds of innovation to tackle the thorniest problems in building environment performance. Success requires bold innovation around electricity and thermal systems.

We are looking for a machine learning engineer to join our team in our New York City office. In your first project you will build models and programs that reduce energy use in buildings and cut greenhouse gas emissions through analysis of building management system (BMS) data and other similar systems.

It's a bonus (but not a requirement) if you are familiar with building systems and IoT sensors, their data, and analysis of it (e.g., HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting, etc.).

What is required is passion for sustainability and the desire to create a climate positive community.

What you have you achieve:
Within your first 6 months, you will:

Build from scratch our initial models for studying and reducing energy usage.
Model energy use and reductions, including creating regression-based energy baselines.
Build and refine recommendation engines and predictive models (e.g. time to reach set point, monthly energy consumption).
Create dashboards and interactive visualizations to share ongoing data.
Design communication models catered to cohorts.
Design and build data pipelines and processes for optimal and secure processing of complex data sets.
Develop methods and naming schemas to unify (messy) data from building systems, sensors, APIs, and other sources, enabling a streamlined way to analyze data and prototype use cases.
Build in security and privacy by design.

What we expect:

Know your computer science.
Have a CS background to choose the right algorithms, systems approaches and patterns to solve problems without reinventing the wheel.
Candidates must be able to hit the ground running. Therefore, we generally look for 3+ years of industry experience in a world-class engineering organization.
Experience with Python and at least one systems programming language (C++, Java, or Go). Experience with Google Cloud Platform and/or Kubernetes a plus
Have in-depth experience delivering algorithms and implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines.
Be a technologist.
Bias towards action and shipping. Once you've sketched out an idea, you find the fastest path to a prototype to prove the concept.
You are obsessed with privacy and constantly ask how we can build privacy into product design.
Be comfortable with a range of languages and open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.
Solve problems, together.
Come up with novel solutions, working well with technologists and non-technologists alike.
Ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
Have flexibility to work on the team's most pressing problems.
Passionate about cities.
You have thought about the urban environment and care deeply about improving the lives of urban citizens.

We are very excited to hear from you.

You have deep experience in probabilistic reasoning and computational problem solving and a healthy dose of obsession about accuracy, reliability, robustness, and scalability. You are very comfortable diving deep into topics such as Bayesian ML, autoencoders, generative models, adversarial training, etc.
You possess the ability to see the big picture, question the norm, and articulate the problem.
You can translate relatively abstract ideas into concrete workable solutions.
You enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge technologies that may be relatively immature at the time of their use.
You are good in identifying the technology trade-offs and can synthesize pragmatic solutions to the problems at hand by judiciously leveraging published and open-source technologies.
You are a strong programmer and are not afraid to dive in large code bases. You take pride in your code and enjoy contributing to open source projects.

Professionals won't just use our system to manage their time but to create it.

And we need your help.

****************
Our Vision
****************

We believe that time is the most valuable thing we can spend. We also believe that professionals are wasting a staggering amount of time at work because they have no idea where they are spending it. Previously, professionals had to manually record every six-minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. We are automating this workflow so professionals can concentrate on creating value, not being administrators.

And that's just the beginning. We will then leverage the data we collect to optimize the way work is priced and performed across these trillion-dollar industries. If done correctly, we'll allow professionals to output in 4 hours what now takes them 10. This gives you an opportunity to impact the world at scale - give people back time they'd otherwise lose forever and empower them to spend it with intention.

Build powerful machine learning models, including feature engineering, model selection, and parameter tuning; create solutions that balance the need for accuracy with the need for security and privacy of customer data
Deploy those models and monitor performance via user behavior over time
Apply system-level strategic thinking; analyze how our machine learning models can adapt to insights from new data sources and identify creative ways to expand those datasets
Scale machine learning infrastructure, such as model management for an online model training pipeline
Coordinate and align with the software engineering, product, and design teams on data flow, user requirements, and UI/UX decisions

******************
Requirements
******************

We heavily emphasize rapid growth and development for our team members. The ability to learn and iterate quickly is valued as much as the skillset you come in with. The ideal candidate would have:


Experience with handling and formatting large quantities of raw, unstructured, and noisy text data using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, nltk, and spaCy
Proficiency in developing and building models in Python with libraries such as Scikit-learn, Keras, and XGBoost.
Experience deploying models in production at scale (e.g., via Flask/WSGI server)
Familiarity with engineering best practices such as unit testing, continuous integration, and version control
The ability to build and deploy quick demos and prototypes via web or native apps.
Excellent communication skills.

Nice-to-haves include:

PhD or Masters degree in a related field of study (e.g., Computer Science, Linguistics, Statistics, Mathematics), or equivalent professional experience
Experience with natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and document summarization.

Triplebyte helps companies find and hire great technical talent. For any company building software, this is crucial for success. A recent survey of top C-Level Executives, across multiple industries, showed that software, R&D and recruiting technical talent are the top areas they are planning increased investment and budget over the next 5 years. Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s online technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.

We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 40 will double in size during 2019. Now is a great time to join as we're on an exciting growth trajectory. You will have lots of opportunity for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.

We have built Machine Learning models that predict the likelihood of an engineer getting an offer from a particular company. Interviewing and assessing engineering talent tends to be noisy, but our technical assessment has proven to be good enough to extract meaningful signals. We collect data on interview results and in-house evaluations, which gives us a unique dataset to play with. We've used that data to deliver a 40% conversion rate on our candidates at interview to offer, compared to the industry standard 20%.

Our mission is to create a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently route it to the best place, streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process, while removing human biases that can hold back some candidates.

Our Mission
We believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We're building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper.

Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like ""gut feel"" or ""culture fit"". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That's the company we're building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. Starting with software engineers."

Work with product, operations, and sales teams to help define use cases, and develop methodology and benchmarks to evaluate different machine learning approaches
",None Found,None Found,"Picnic's mission is to structure the world's medical data to make it useful. We work directly with patients to collect, digitize,and manage their complete medical records, giving them with control over their care through a personal health timeline ( http://demo.picnichealth.com/ ). We also partner with biotech, genomics, and pharma companies who sponsor PicnicHealth accounts for research volunteers. Through this work we're building the data sets that power some of today's most cutting edge medical research.

ML at Picnic
Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 15,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition ( https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/announcing-winners-our-machine-learning-startup-competition/ ).

Strong software engineering skills as evidenced by contributions to open-source machine learning libraries.
Strong problem solving skills.","Pit.AI Technologies is taking on one of the most exciting challenges of our time, namely solving intelligence, in one of the most competitive industries ever, investment management!

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.

We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.

We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.


Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Machine Learning Engineer. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.


You'll be expected to be the gatekeeper to our production machine learning code base. As such, you will be required to demonstrate strong software engineering skills, as well as the ability to both understand and implement novel machine learning methodological contributions (e.g. latest JMLR/NIPS/ICML/AISTATS/UAI articles) related to probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization. You'll be expected to have a critical impact on the bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.


When tasked with solving a new problem, the ideal candidate will typically prefer thinking from first principles, and will favor simplicity and principled approaches over the latest 'hot' NIPS paper or arXiv submission he/she has read that appears remotely connected. At the same time, he/she is expected to have a profound understanding of the state-of-the-art, and should not shy away from mathematical complexity when it makes business sense.


Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.


We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Use cutting-edge CV deep learning techniques to solve the aforementioned challenges",None Found,None Found,"Problem
In the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.

Root cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it’s too late to fix the problem.

Solution
Doxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated RoI of eliminating overages entirely and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.

Doxel has taken the market by storm since it’s launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.

Team
Doxel’s team consists of some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley that include PhDs, engineers, business leaders and civil engineering professionals on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, graduates from Stanford University and with experience at organizations such as Google Advanced Technologies & Projects.

Doxel is backed by Andreessen Horowitz - famed investor that also backed Facebook, Coinbase, Slack, Airbnb, Github and Lyft.

The Role
Doxel is building a distributed infrastructure to capture physical data via LIDAR scanners. We’ll have dozens of robots running in the field, multi-gigabyte data uploads from remote locations, and large data pipelines process the data and applying cutting-edge computer vision ML techniques. Our customers expect fast data turn around and reliable reports. Your job will be to build the software that turns point clouds into insights for the world’s top construction companies.

You’re a machine learning expert that wants to push the boundaries of computer vision in the real world. You salivate at the idea of thousands of high-resolution LIDAR scans waiting to be trained on to teach our robots to “see” and identify objects on construction sites. You’re impact focused and not content with just theoretical results - you make sure your models actually work in the field (quite literally for us!).
