       "      <td>Consistently named one of the top D.C. start-ups to watch since 2016, Quorum is software built for public affairs. Thousands of public affairs professionals use Quorum for their work in Congress, all 50 state legislatures, major U.S. cities, and the European Union. Quorum is 100% bootstrapped—meaning we have never raised venture capital funding—and works with organizations like Coca-Cola, the United Nations Foundation, Sierra Club, General Motors, and Lyft.\\n\\nOur engineers work the full-stack using tools like React/Redux, Django, PostgreSQL, React Native, and much more. We are looking to fill multiple roles for junior to senior Software Engineers where you will be working in an interdisciplinary, teamwork-oriented environment to help build the most powerful advocacy platform on the market.\\n\\nWhat You'll Do\\n\\nFirst Week: you'll ship new code to production\\nFirst Month: you'll write code at several levels of the stack, from infrastructure to the API to the UI\\nFirst Six Months: you'll take ownership of an entire set of features and make decisions that impact many clients\\nFirst Year: you'll help guide our team as we make broad technical decisions impacting our stack, our products, and the growth of the entire company\\nAbout You\\n\\nYou care deeply about the code you write and either have significant technical skills solving real-world problems or the drive to quickly develop them\\nYou're a highly-motivated self-starter who wants to make valuable contributions to a team from day 1\\nYou're an engaged learner - you want to expand your skills, get your hands dirty, and find solutions to challenging problems that require tradeoffs\\nYou want to work in a fun environment where you can form real friendships with other professionals and where you have a strong sense of belonging at a growing startup\\nYou're excited to pitch in wherever needed, from helping in recruiting to supporting customers\\nYou are looking to join a dynamic team immediately\\nAbout the Development Team\\n\\nWe're a small team that works fast. Iterating and shipping code quickly is in our DNA. Done is better than perfect, but we do our best to build systems that let us move quickly without breaking too many things.\\nWe support many different products but internally think of them as one system with a single unified codebase. Our goal is to build centralized systems that handle the hard stuff for multiple features and products.\\nWe live on the cutting edge of software engineering in both our frontend and backend. We rely heavily on open source tools but aren't afraid to dig in and make something better ourselves.\\nWe're very close as a team - we work together, hang out together, eat together, and some of us even live together. Previously, The Washingtonian described us as \"DC's nerdiest group house... shaking up Washington’s oldest trade.\"\\nOur Work Environment\\n\\nWe work in a vibrant, sunlit space in our modern, open concept office\\nOur office building is located in the heart of downtown DC, easily accessible by metro, bus, and rideshares. It is also in close proximity to great restaurants, food trucks, shopping, and popular happy hour spots\\nOur team loves to spend time doing fun things outside of the office, which we call Quorum Fun events. Past Quorum Fun events have included apple picking, yoga, and wine tasting\\nDo you want to learn what it's like to have a real impact at a fast-growing company that is changing the way the advocacy process works? If so, drop us a line. We'd love to talk to you!\\n\\nCompensation Structure\\n\\nBase Salary: $88,000.00 - $135,000.00 (commensurate with experience)\\nPlus upward base salary adjustments based upon company growth and equity\\nBenefits: 401(k) match, health/dental, 12-weeks paid maternity/paternity/adoption/fostering leave, unlimited PTO, and more.\\nQuorum Is Working to Advance Pay Equity: What Does That Mean For You?\\n\\nIn an effort to continue to build a diverse and inclusive work environment that advances pay equity, Quorum has implemented a “No Negotiation” policy for base salary for new hires for roles that are currently staffed by three or more team members. This means that candidates for the Full-Stack Software Engineer role cannot negotiate Quorum’s base salary offer.\\n\\nHere’s our promise to you:\\n\\nWe will not ask you what you are currently earning.\\nWe will consider years of relevant experience, relevant professional certifications/education, and performance expectations in setting what we believe is a competitive, fair base salary offer.\\nWe will be transparent about our compensation structure (see above) so that all candidates have equal access to compensation information and can make an informed decision about whether or not Quorum is the right workplace for them.\\nIf you are interested in learning more about how negotiation impacts pay equity and/or why other start-ups have decided to implement a “No Negotiation” policy of some type, here are a few resources: Project Include, AAUW, Ministry for Women, Magoosh.\\n\\nNote: Quorum does not endorse or verify any of the information provided in the resources on the impact of negotiation on pay equity. We provide these resources simply to increase awareness of a topic we believe is important for both employers and candidates to consider.</td>\n",

If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\\n\\nThe Role\\n\\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.\\n\\nFDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.\\n\\nYou work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions.
