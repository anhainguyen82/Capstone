At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
Some of the things our Software Engineers have done:
Built a web-based mapping interface that handles millions of data points dynamically displayed at once.
Constructed an analysis platform on top of a columnar database and custom infrastructure that allows complex numerical analysis at the petabyte scale.
Built AtlasDB, which provides high-scale, reliable data storage for Palantir products. This NoSQL distributed data store adds a transactional layer that gives the whole system ACID properties.
Developed a WYSIWYG web app for quickly creating interactive, data-driven web sites.
Worked on a variety of Palantir open-source projects. Some of our favorites, available on our GitHub page, are Blueprint, Plottable, TSLint, and AtlasDB.
Technologies We Use
A variety of languages including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend.
Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux.
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github.
What We Value
Must be planning on graduating in 2020
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics
Advanced-level Computer Science coursework, including in algorithms and data structures; experience with Java and/or web technologies a plus
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data

11,Software Engineer (Systems) - Health Core Infrastructure,"Seattle, WA",Seattle,WA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Health is Twitter’s top priority and we need your help.


We build and maintain the large-scale, low latency distributed systems that power Twitter’s real-time feature computation, rule engine, and data exploration tools that keep spam, abuse, and adversarial accounts off of Twitter.


If you want to work on a team that does some of the most interesting technical work at Twitter, protects people from real harm, and has executive-level visibility, then this is the team for you.

Who We Are
We’re a team of systems engineers that builds and maintains the core infrastructure helping to protect the health of the public conversation. We’re motivated by interesting technical challenges - our real-time feature computation and rules engine runs thousands of rules on half a million events per second - as well as internal and external customer impact. We work closely with our customers in Trust and Safety, User Services and Data Science to provide a platform for technical and nontechnical customers to deploy new features and rules at scale in seconds.


Our work sits at the intersection of a number of interesting disciplines. We do large-scale real-time event processing that needs to catch some of the smartest adversaries. Our flexible platform serves numerous important internal customers. And we build and maintain a grammar, compiler, and tooling for a Turing-complete rules and feature computation language.


We deploy continuously, write unit tests, and do code review.
What You’ll Do
Here are some of the daily duties of the role:

Extend the functionality of the platform, including new language features and new integrations with other systems, to serve our customers’ needs.
Profile and stress test to surface inefficiencies in our system.
Tune cache and storage to optimize our runtime performance.
Diagnose issues and debug across the entire stack.
Work with platform services we depend on, including storage, messaging and data platform teams.
Give conference talks, write blog posts, and otherwise evangelize Twitter health engineering internally and externally.
Lead small, hungry project teams to impactful infrastructure wins.
Communicate with stakeholders and build consensus around the technical roadmap.
Who You Are
You’ve built and maintained a large-scale distributed system before and have the scars to prove it.
You value deleted code - and code never written - just as much as the code that you do write.
You’re willing to be coached and to coach others.
You know when it’s okay to take on technical debt and you eventually pay it down.
You can balance quality work vs customer requests vs new features.
You can make the right product and technical decisions independently.


Here’s all the legal good stuff:

We are committed to an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Twitter is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, veteran, genetic information, marital status or any other legally protected status.

Are you ready to write code for millions of customers? Would you like to point to customer-facing features on one of the most popular websites in the world and say, “I built and shipped that” after your first few weeks on the job? As a Software Developer on the Ask team you will envision and create features that touch every Amazon customer and transform the online shopping experience.

Who you’ll work with: The Ask team owns customer Q&A features on Detail Page and other ingresses in the Amazon Retail ecosystem. Our goal is to help answer customer questions as fast as possible. We employ lean agile development and work in two-week iterations and ship code daily. We hate building stuff that customers don’t want, so before we invest in large production systems we quickly validate our hypotheses with small tests. We are incredibly close to customers: as an engineer on our team, you will regularly call customers to learn more about their experiences with our program. When we do build out systems for scale, they must handle a blistering number of transactions per second. We take pride in owning our entire code stack, from how fast our templates render in the customer’s browser through to our service layer and down to the underlying data model. We are a diverse team from a variety of backgrounds and interests who love dreaming up, validating, and shipping features that deliver big customer impact.

The problems you’ll work on: You will build software that engages the Amazon community to get answers to customer product questions as quickly as possible. Our problem space provides a unique blend of challenges: you will build social features to connect customers to one another, you will play with large datasets, you will analyze customer-submitted content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques and you will build distributed systems to make this content available in real time to our customers.

Some example challenges that face our engineering team every day:
How would you help a customer who is shopping for a new camera lens find the right information? What if the website doesn’t have the information? How would you determine who in the Amazon community we should direct this question to?What are the most important questions to a customer before making a purchase? How would you automatically answer these questions before the customer even knows what to ask?Everyone on the team is a product owner. How can you continuously improve the Ask experience for customers every day? What are your ideas to change the shopping experience? How do you make them a reality for millions of customers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Interviews are the gateway between people and jobs--they are a critical connection point. And yet, while the interview is a universal experience, it has never been recognized as its own discipline. In fact, the vast majority of people conducting interviews receive no formal training in how to do so ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/interview-gap-economic-growth-tech-industry/ ).

Karat is the market leader in Interview Engineering
---------------------------------------------------

At Karat, our mission is to make every interview predictive, fair, and enjoyable. To do so, we created and established the category of Interview Engineering.

Karat conducts technical interviews on behalf of organizations hiring software engineers. We do this through a community of Interview Engineers who are equipped with Karat's interviewing infrastructure, battle-tested questions, and data-informed best practices. The result is highly predictive and fair interviews at scale that candidates truly enjoy. Karat has amassed the largest, most robust dataset of structured-interview intelligence to produce never-before-seen hiring analytics.

Founded in 2014, Karat is a privately held and venture-funded company ( https://news.crunchbase.com/news/karat-raises-28m-series-b-led-by-tiger-global/ ) based in Seattle. Key clients include Pinterest, PayPal, Citrix, Intuit, and InVision.

Engineering at Karat
--------------------

We've all been through technical interviews (one side or the other). As a member of Karat's engineering team, you'll work on key innovations to the Karat interviewing infrastructure with engineers who care about the product, their craftsmanship, and the team. We usually work in Ruby and Python, taking care to thoroughly test and continuously deploy our code.

You believe in our mission and crave the ownership and responsibility we will give you.
You have a self-starter attitude to learn, build, ship, and own.
You have experience working on web applications - you know how HTTP, Rest, and web security works.
You're comfortable working on dynamic user experiences using AJAX and modern frameworks like Angular or React as well as plain old JavaScript.
You're at home in a Unix/Linux workflow.
You have a distinct passion for product driven development and you love writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code.
You have a desire to learn and improve your craftsmanship, plus you will always go the extra mile to provide happiness to your customers.
Interviewing, teaching, or mentoring experience is a plus as it will help you relate to our mission and culture.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.
What We Value
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data

About Avalara
Avalara solves Tax. But its not like you may think. Imagine every product you buy, every service you subscribe to, every transaction you make. It all needs to be taxed. Every city, county, state, country taxes differently and every transaction which crosses those boundaries (effectively every transaction) needs to account for those differences. Now imagine retailer (brick/online), the wholesaler, manufacturer, importer/exporter and the depth and breadth of the challenge in getting the tax right. Avalara takes on that burden and makes it easier for businesses of all sizes to do businesses globally. It's a very challenging domain in terms of scale, reliability and complexity and Avalara does it better than anyone.
The perks of working at Avalara go beyond amazing physical spaces and a Tiki Bar. We’re committed to continued progress in diversity and inclusion. As an employee at Avalara, you’ll have the opportunity to join resource groups focused on diversity of thought, engage with your local or global community about topics that matter to you and the organization and receive continued education around inclusion and development. As Avalara grows, so do the voices within it. It’s time to hear your voice.
Avalara is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified candidates will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, age, gender, nation of origin, disability, sexual orientation, US Veteran status, or any other factor protected by law.

",None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"The Role

The main moving piece of the Outreach product is the system which manages communications with customers by synchronizing user inboxes. That system is owned by the Customer Engagement Actions Team. The team’s goal is to drive efficient revenue generation by enabling Outreach users to make efficient contacts, keep in touch with their customers, and comply with data management and security policies.

The calendar and email team is seeking a back-end engineer to come work with us to build the next generation of cutting-edge communication features.

About the Team

Our system handles more than one million emails and calendar events daily. Nearly everything an Outreach customer does involves our part of the system, and we never want to be in the way of our users reaching their customers - or their goals. We’re charged with designing and delivering interesting features, like automated reply detection, which requires a crisp design approach to answer nebulous and challenging problems.

We work with a disparate set of third-party APIs to implement our system, integrating with email and scheduling systems like Google Mail and Calendar, and Microsoft Office 365. Customers trust us with their privacy and data, and with their customer contacts. New legislation and practices (like GDPR) demand compliance that we take seriously, and they keep our work dynamic.

We're always concerned with making sure the outward interfaces we implement are up and running. But we’re also working to scale them to larger volumes so we can accommodate even bigger customers. Our road-map contains a rich suite of features for our customers focusing on communication flexibility and efficiency.

On the Customer Engagement Actions Team We:

Implement support for features in browser and email client add-ins
Ship code to production every day
Help our customers drive customer communication, resulting in effective and efficient sales contacts that drive their organization’s revenue
Do Agile development, with Kanban and regular retrospectives
Function in a highly progressive, quick-iteration environment focused on delivering consistent, incremental customer value
Are highly collaborative and foster a learning environment
Own the back-end implementation of the front line; a system that provides and monitors direct contact with our users and their customers over email and calendaring interfaces

Your Daily Adventures Will Include
Building applications in a modern web stack. We primarily use Ruby on Rails on the back-end, though there are services written in Go, Node and Elixir. We have data stores built on Redis, MySQL, and S3. We are beginning to adopt GraphQL. We use CircleCI/Concourse for continuous integration. Our platform runs on AWS using Kubernetes.
Work with back-end APIs from third parties to efficiently implement our features
Respond to changing requirements efficiently and responsibly
Helping us build customer trust by keeping the quality bar high and delivering well tested code
Quickly become a strong contributor on the team

",None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"The Role

The main moving piece of the Outreach product is the system which manages communications with customers by synchronizing user inboxes. That system is owned by the Customer Engagement Actions Team. The team’s goal is to drive efficient revenue generation by enabling Outreach users to make efficient contacts, keep in touch with their customers, and comply with data management and security policies.

Our team needs people to help us with our ambitious goals.

About the Team

Our system handles more than one million emails and calendar events daily. Nearly everything an Outreach customer does involves our part of the system, and we never want to be in the way of our users reaching their customers - or their goals. We’re charged with designing and delivering interesting features, like automated reply detection, which requires a crisp design approach to answer nebulous and challenging problems.

We work with a disparate set of third-party APIs to implement our system, integrating with email and scheduling systems like Google Mail and Calendar, and Microsoft Office 365. Customers trust us with their privacy and data, and with their customer contacts. New legislation and practices (like GDPR) demand compliance that we take seriously, and they keep our work dynamic.

We're always concerned with making sure the outward interfaces we implement are up and running. But we’re also working to scale them to larger volumes so we can accommodate even bigger customers. Our road-map contains a rich suite of features for our customers focusing on communication flexibility and efficiency.

On the Customer Engagement Actions Team We:

Implement support for features in browser and email client add-ins
Ship code to production every day
Help our customers drive customer communication, resulting in effective and efficient sales contacts that drive their organization’s revenue
Do Agile development, with Kanban and regular retrospectives
Function in a highly progressive, quick-iteration environment focused on delivering consistent, incremental customer value
Are highly collaborative and foster a learning environment
Own the back-end implementation of the front line; a system that provides and monitors direct contact with our users and their customers over email and calendaring interfaces

Your Daily Adventures Will Include
Building high quality web applications in a modern web stack. The software we currently use includes React, Typescript, Webpack, Jest, Babel, GraphQL and CSS Modules.
Making changes in in our Ruby on Rails back-end application services as needed to implement front-end features
Collaborating with designers to implement intuitive user interfaces
Responding to changing requirements efficiently and responsibly
Helping us build customer trust by keeping the quality bar high and delivering well tested code
Working with stakeholders to gather and understand requirements
Learning new tools and skill sets
Quickly becoming a strong contributor on the team

226,Full Stack Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA 98134",Seattle,WA,98134,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Glowforge is a beautiful device that sits on your desk. It uses a laser to carve and engrave products from raw materials like wood, leather, acrylic – even cardboard. If you haven’t already, check out our video on glowforge.com. While you’re there, you’ll notice something amazing: Glowforge is the largest crowdfunding campaign in history.

There is an incredible demand for what we’re creating. It’s not a geeky tool for the tech elite or a garage workshop; we’re crafting an iconic product that is going to change the way people think about creativity. Our customers include consumers, digital designers, crafters, engineers, teachers, artists, and more.

This is a full-time role in Seattle, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this alluring city.

Why we need you
One of the unusual things about the Glowforge architecture is that we moved many of the hard engineering problems from hardware to software. Our cloud service does the heavy lifting for features like alignment and autofocus. It also makes it dead easy to diagram, draw, or doodle your invention and print it directly to wood, acrylic, fabric, leather, or paper.

Our team is composed of software generalists and we expect you to be one too, but we particularly want your passion and thoughtfulness around our end-to-end web stack. While you’ll do lots of things here, you’ll be asked to tackle problems at every layer of a full-featured web stack, and will spread your knowledge and experience through an organization that is eager to learn. And there’s a lot for you to work on: you’ll be helping with everything from user-facing software to the web services that drive our hardware.

While this role is written for someone with a four-year degree and several years of industry experience, if you’re great at what you do and excited about what we do, we want to talk to you — whether you’re brand new to the industry or you’ve been a veteran architect for decades.

Here’s what you’ll be doing
First and foremost, any task that helps us create an amazing product for our customers — which will include stretching your coding skills in new directions and pitching in when your colleagues need help.
Driving the decisions about what technologies to add to the stack. We already use Rails, Node, and Python but have a lot more work to do.
Working closely with the hardware team to understand the capabilities of our product and help unlock its potential.
Participating in planning sessions with the whole product team and can help build the user stories, requirements and specifications that will drive development.
Building the software to fabricate the future – not just another CRUD app.
You need these qualifications
You write copious amounts of thoughtful, high-quality code.
You’ve been responsible for shipping a web product that people love.
You’re excited about being personally responsible for making Glowforge successful, and you’re comfortable navigating ambiguity that arises in a startup environment, adjusting to changing priorities, and moving confidently even when guidance is limited.
You’re thoughtful about systems engineering, design patterns, and algorithms.
You’re passionate about writing great software… and still know that you sometimes have to make some tradeoffs to ship quickly.
It would be nice if…
You’re experienced with back-end server technologies and designing for the *ilities (testability, maintainability, extensibility, scalability, and security-ility).
You’re familiar with hardware challenges like drivers, motion controller algorithms, and/or low-level code (you’ll be working closely with the hardware team and may have the opportunity to build low-level interfaces).
You have graphics experience.
You’re comfortable with Javascript, CSS, and HTML (big chunks of our product are user-facing web software)
This is a full-time role in Seattle, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this beautiful city. Send us a resume or a link to whatever showcases your skills the best. If a resume isn’t handy, a LinkedIn profile or GitHub account is fine.

There's one more, very important thing. We are an equal opportunity employer. We search for amazing people of diverse backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives.
