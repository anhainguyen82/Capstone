Two fast-moving startups (MindMeld and Accompany) were recently acquired by Cisco to disrupt and boost the industry's #1 Collaboration portfolio. We aim to build the next generation of collaboration software &amp; devices - from digitizing the in-meeting experience, enhancing distributed team efficiency and improving all aspects of people connection.\\nIn this role, you'll work on our People Insights features. People Insights provides our customers with perfect context on the people they are meeting and collaborating with, right when they need it. We render rich profiles on the people you're meeting with right inside Webex, so that you have the context you need right at your fingertips... Who are you meeting with? What are the most important facts about the company they work for? Do you have anything in common with them?\\nPeople Insights helps customers answer all these questions and more, and we do it by curating the world's largest database of senior decision makers in the world. We are building a proprietary data platform that scours billions of pages on the web and uses intelligence and machine learning to create the richest, most real-time profiles in the world for hundreds of millions of people and tens of millions of companies.\\nHow do you decide which parts of the web to crawl? How do you extract structured data from unstructured text? How do you efficiently keep this data up to date? With this people and company data, we're building services that can operate at scale to deliver personalized data and competitive insights. How do you store and query all this data efficiently? What unique deductions and insights might you make from it?\\nAnd to display this personalized data and these competitive insights, we're building fast, powerful features across Cisco's entire portfolio of collaboration apps that are a delight for our customers to use. How do you show so much data while still keeping a UI simple and easy to use? How do you build powerful functionality while staying extremely performant?\\nPeople Insights is ripe with exciting technical challenges, most of which have yet to be solved here and some of which have yet to be solved anywhere!\\n\\nWho You’ll Work With\\nWe have a small but mighty team of engineers who are exceptionally talented and all low ego. Many of our engineers have founded their own startups prior to forming Webex Intelligence, in domains ranging from crowdfunding to dynamic pricing to real-time document editing. Others have built significant infrastructure at larger companies like Google and Amazon. We draw on this well of experiences every day as we collaborate on our own product, tech stack, and go to market strategy. We're all highly collaborative, committed to building great things, and consider it a privilege to learn from each other every day.\\n\\nWho You Are\\nYou take pride in building and shipping fabulous software. You thrive on ownership and autonomy, but are also committed tocollaborating and communicating across the team's different stakeholders and domain experts. You enjoy working in an interdisciplinary environment that requires interfacing cross-functionally, from product to sales to customer support. You hold yourself and your teammates to a very high degree of quality in everything you do. You're hungry to apply the skills you already have, and to learn new ones from the work you'll do and team you'll work with. You thrive on constructive feedback and you deliver results that matter.\\nRequirements\\nExperience writing robust systems that have served real customers\\nSolid foundation in Computer Science (algorithms, data structures, software design)\\nGreat can-do attitude and ability to thrive and learn in a fast-paced environment\\nStrong written and verbal communication abilities and a commitment to using them\\nDesire to work on a highly scalable and available system used by tens of millions of users daily\\nMost of our codebase is in Ruby and C++, but languages can be learned. We prioritize general programming ability over any specific language experience.\\nExperience being a generalist—curiosity about and ability to work on different parts of the system (backend, front-end, mobile, data mining, machine learning)\\n\\nWhy Cisco\\nAt Cisco, each person brings their unique talents to work as a team and make a difference. Yes, our technology changes the way the world works, lives, plays and learns, but our edge comes from our people.\\nWe connect everything – people, process, data and things – and we use those\\nconnections to change our world for the better.\\nWe innovate everywhere - From launching a new era of networking that adapts, learns and protects, to building Cisco Services that accelerate businesses and business results. Our technology powers entertainment, retail, healthcare, education and more – from Smart Cities to your everyday devices.\\nWe benefit everyone - We do all of this while striving for a culture that empowers every person to be the difference, at work and in our communities.\\nColorful hair?

       "0    About Blue River\\n\\nBlue River Technology serves the agricultural industry by designing and building advanced farm machines that utilize computer vision and machine learning to enable farmers to understand and manage every plant. These machines help farmers to improve profitability, protects the environment by reducing pesticide use, and captures valuable plant-by-plant data. Blue River is a pioneer in the agricultural robotics space and has developed the See & Spray precision sprayer, which applies pesticide only where needed, and can reduce pesticide use 90%.\\n\\nJohn Deere & Company, with over 180 years of experience in designing, manufacturing, and distributing innovative products to farmers, acquired Blue River Technology in the fall of 2017 as an independently run subsidiary. In partnership with John Deere, Blue River has expanded rapidly and together both companies see many opportunities to apply advanced computer vision, machine learning, and robotics technologies to other areas in agriculture beyond spraying.\\n\\nBlue River is based in Sunnyvale, CA and has 100+ team members with diverse experience including computer vision, machine learning, systems software, autonomous vehicles and precision agriculture.
