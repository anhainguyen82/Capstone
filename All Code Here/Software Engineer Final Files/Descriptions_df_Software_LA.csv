Professional experience in one or more of the following:

Spatiotemporal data processing. We use a combination of industry-standard tools and custom libraries to efficiently represent, partition, and store geospatial information. Our biggest challenges happen where theoretical considerations meet real world data.
Big Data / MapReduce. For data processing and storage, we primarily use Hadoop, and invest our effort here in finding the right approaches to sorting, managing pipelines, serialization/deserialization, and the integration of batch and real-time processing.
Performance tuning, especially on the JVM. On the opposite side of our big data challenges are the code paths that are executed millions of times per second. Here we leverage a combination of flame graphs, wrk2 and other benchmarking tools, and YourKit / VisualVM profiling to maintain performance even as we grow in scope and scale.
Management of Java teams and large Java codebases. As Factual continues to grow, we're focusing on establishing the right processes around design and architecture, coding best practices, and effective methodologies as they relate to Java software development.

Company Overview
Founded in 1931, Capital Group (“Capital”) is one of the world’s largest and most trusted investment management firms, managing more than US $1.8 trillion in equity and fixed-income assets on behalf of over 55 million individual and institutional investors in 28 offices around the world. With 7,500 associates across five continents, Capital strives to improve people’s lives through successful investing.

Capital takes great pride in helping millions of investors fulfill their dreams and financial goals. The firm assists investors in achieving financial outcomes that are otherwise unobtainable on their own, from home ownership and higher education to a comfortable retirement. It has always been essential to Capital’s business to espouse values that include mutual respect, fairness and integrity.
Private ownership is key to the organization, allowing the firm to focus on the future, even if its views prove unpopular the short term. The firm’s financial position is managed conservatively to ensure financial strength through market cycles, and is committed to sustainable, balanced growth while maintaining healthy profitability. Capital strives to fulfill its obligation as stewards and do what is best for clients over time, with due consideration for associates and Capital Group shareholders.

The Capital organization is composed of groups that perform securities analysis and portfolio management, market and distribute the organization’s investment products, provide service and operational support, and operate the firm’s technology infrastructure. Investment offerings span public equity, fixed income and balanced portfolios. Clients include institutions such as public and corporate retirement plans (defined benefit and defined contribution), endowments and foundations, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions, retail investors (who invest via the American Funds mutual fund family in the U.S.) and high-net-worth individuals (served by the Private Client Services group).

This is an exciting time to join Capital. The firm is making significant investments in the future, as evidenced by the many initiatives underway across the organization to enhance competitive positioning, improve the way the firm operates, and, ultimately, provide superior investment results and service to clients and investors.

Company Overview:

Capital’s core mission is to improve people’s lives through successful investing. To accomplish this, the firm invests clients’ assets based on rigorous research and careful attention to risk. The firm believes that active investing, provided by the right managers at the right price, produces significant advantages to investors over the long term. The job of the long-term active manager is to look for value in enough places to help investors do better than the market average over meaningful periods of time. Capital’s track record speaks for itself and the firm takes pride in the level of transparency both in investment results and the cost to the investor for us to achieve those results. The firm’s portfolio managers are among the most experienced in the industry, with an average of 27 years of industry experience and 22 years of experience at Capital.

Over several decades, Capital has developed a unique approach to portfolio management that shuns the “star system” in favor of a multi-manager structure called The Capital System. With each investment offering, the firm begins by defining a clear investment objective and assembling a diverse team of portfolio managers and investment research analysts best equipped to pursue the universe of investment opportunities available. The Capital System is designed to enable individual investment professionals to act on their highest convictions, while limiting the risk associated with isolated decision-making. Funds using The Capital System are divided into portions that are overseen independently by investment professionals with diverse backgrounds, ages and investment approaches. Capital’s commitment to a consistent and thoughtful approach to investing is reflected in strong financial results for the firm; 2017 was the second-best year in the firm’s history for sales.

American Funds is one of only four firms to earn the highest Morningstar Stewardship Grade of “A.” The grade is based on management practices, manager tenure and investment performance, and includes factors such as corporate culture, fund board quality, portfolio manager incentives, fees and regulatory history.
In 2018, thirteen American Funds have been cited for excellence by Morningstar® in its annual FundInvestor℠ “Fantastic 46” list – the most of any fund family. In addition, Morningstar, Inc. recognized the Capital team of investment professionals who manage the New Perspective Fund (ANWPX) as the 2015 International-Stock Fund Manager of the Year in the U.S. Morningstar annually reviews nearly 8,000 mutual funds in total to identify this select group of funds considered for criteria such as expenses, manager ownership, returns, stewardship, and risk ratings.

In 2017, American Funds also won 24 Lipper awards for three equity funds, New Perspective Fund, Euro Pacific Growth Fund, SMALLCAP World Fund, and for the American Funds Target Date Retirement Series – which took home the most target date awards of any fund family, securing wins in every eligible category. The annual Lipper Awards recognize fund families and individual mutual funds that, relative to their peers, have achieved consistently strong risk-adjusted three, five and ten year results. This was the ninth year in a row Capital took home multiple Lipper Awards.

American Funds was named to Barron’s Best Fund Families ranking for 2016 at number four, up from number 13 for 2015. For this ranking, Barron’s focuses on one-year returns. According to Barron’s, “American [Funds] is best characterized by its steadfast commitment to team management, active investing, and low costs; average expense ratios hover around 0.3%, on par with even the cheapest ETFs. Price alone doesn’t explain [Capital’s] showing,” the article continues. “Out of the more than 800 American Funds scored for this ranking (including individual share classes), just 17 fell into the bottom decile of their Lipper peer groups.” This includes at least three mutual funds or ETFs in Lipper’s general U.S. equity category, one in world equity, and one in mixed-asset, as well as two taxable bond funds and one tax-exempt bond fund. Sixty-one firms met this criteria this year. Capital’s operating principles and devotion to clients’ objectives are also reflected in the firm’s culture. Capital strives to stay humble by recognizing how difficult it is to achieve extraordinary results for clients, and that any success is due to the hard work of talented and unique individuals working together. It is a core tenant of Capital’s culture to do the right thing as a matter of principle, not just in observance of policy.

The work environment at Capital is collegial, intellectually rigorous and honest. Everyone is expected to contribute both as an individual and as a member of a team. Another distinct hallmark of Capital’s philosophy is its focus on long-term investment results, relationship management and the stewardship of the organization itself. After 85 years, Capital remains a vibrant and dynamic organization engaged in continuously improving the way it operates, aligning its strengths as an asset manager to the needs of investors around the world.
Capital champions an environment of mutual respect. The firm values diversity and is built on fundamental values that shape decision-making and the way Capital interacts with clients, investors and one another:

Integrity Capital Group strives to do what is right, no matter what.
Respect for Individuals Capital Group treats people fairly and embrace their diversity.
Collaboration Capital Group works openly and constructively together.
Humility Capital Group focuses on their clients, not themselves.
Long Term Focus Capital Group acts with the long-term interests of their clients in mind.
Rigorous Analysis Capital Group makes decisions based on evaluation of sound research.
Consistency Capital Group can be counted on to act in a predictable manner.
Accountability Capital Group takes responsibility for their actions and deliver what is agreed upon.

Just as Capital seeks to make a difference in the lives of investors, the firm supports associates’ efforts to make a difference in their communities. Capital has a strong tradition of service and philanthropy. Each year, associates personally support more than 3,000 nonprofit organizations through donations and volunteer work. In turn, Capital Group and its charitable foundation enhance that support with funding through grants and matching gifts. During the past 10 years, Capital has given more than US$240 million to charitable organizations.

About the job
Hope is not a strategy. Engineering solutions to design, build, and maintain efficient large-scale systems is a true strategy, and a good one.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google's services—both our internally critical and our externally-visible systems—have reliability and uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever-watchful eye on capacity and performance.

SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems—we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. As SREs are responsible for the big picture of how our systems relate to each other, we use a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless postmortems and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day-to-day work.

SRE's culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.

To learn more: check out Site Reliability Engineering, written by Google SREs, watch a recorded Hangout on Air to meet some of our SREs, or read a career profile about why a software engineer chose to join SRE.
Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We're always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.

Our mission is simple: to inspire healthy habits so women can be their best every day.

Our team of curious skeptics is made up of world-class scientists, artists, expert marketers and strategists. We’re well-funded, growing quickly and on a mission to reinvent an entire industry. If you’re a team player who refuses to settle for the status quo, we want you. Welcome to your new daily Ritual.

Essential
When it comes to web development, nothing stands in your way because you have all the tools for success on front-end, back-end, and all the pipes in between. This includes short and mid-term projects that will immediately move key company metrics as well as lay the technical foundation for long-term success.

This is an exciting opportunity and critical role for a very fast-growing brand. We believe that great digital experiences are an important part of any company’s success, and we think you'll agree. As a subscription service, we help our customers better invest in the products they’ve subscribed to, by reinforcing the habits that help them in their long-term mission. You’ll be a part of a strong digital product team of designers, product managers, and data analysts to continuously add to and improve our customers’ experiences online at scale.
What You'll Do
Help lead the design, architecture, and execution of everything from front to back.
Establish engineering processes, define company engineering standards, identify and implement core technologies, and remove technical hurdles.
Work directly with our other Engineers, Designers, Product, and Marketing teams to implement core features across our customers’ experiences.
Build solutions for appropriate scalability. You're ok building something ""hacky"" if it fits the need, but can also call out real issues and create simple, scalable solutions for them.
What You'll Use
Our homepage (marketing pages) use React, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Contentful headless CMS.
Our checkout + account experiences use Ember, JSONAPI, and work directly with our Rails API.
Our back-end is a Rails API that handles everything from account creation, payments, all the way through to fulfillment.
See more here: https://stackshare.io/ritual-com/ritual
Who You Are
An application pioneer. You get jazzed about building experiences for people on the web, helping them get to the things they need, while delighting them wherever they may be. You've worked on creating back-end micro-services, API design/versioning, webhooks, load balancers, caching solutions, serverless tech, database stuff, Rails apps, and more. All over the board, huh? If you can handle anything that's thrown at you – we want you.
Humble Craftsman. You take pride in your work, and look for opportunities to iterate and make it better. You prioritize a simple solution over a complex one, leaning on the tools available to make your job easier, while ensuring solid test coverage backs up the decisions you’ve made.
Data driven. You believe that great data enables you and others to make better decisions.
Collaborator. You can dive deep and have complex technical conversations with your engineering team, nerd out over design decisions, and then turn around and explain those same conversations to non-technical teams.
Up for a challenge. You believe that just because something is difficult that it is not a reason for not doing it. In fact, that might be validation that it is worth doing, right?
What You Need
Education: BS in Computer Science or other engineering/technical field. Equivalent experience also accepted.
Experience: 3-5 years of developing clean, scalable and efficient web apps in a fast-paced environment.
Strong experience in Ruby and front-end Javascript. The ability to build a full web app - back to front, with a passion for strong test coverage.
A demonstrated eye for design, as well as the ability to identify and solve real-world user problems.
An understanding of troubleshooting issues that may arise, and planning for scale.
Interest in learning additional skills/technologies as we continue to scale our platform and suite of tools.
