We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\\n\\n\\nThe Role\\n\\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” FDSEs lead the process of finding answers.\\n\\nAs an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. Like at a startup, you'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll have a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.\\n\\nYou'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you're ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.\\n\\nWith Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly. We often face entirely novel problems, so solving them may require expanding your skillset. For example, we currently use:\\n\\nA variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front endOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and ReduxIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github\\n\\nAnd if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.\\n\\nA career as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could. As you rotate among teams, you'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, finance, and law enforcement. You'll learn from experts in these fields about their problems and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them. Questions that seem simple from the outside will quickly become complex as you consider the nuances and consequences of every possible answer.\\n\\nTechnologies We Use\\nCore Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.\\nCustom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms.\\nPostgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing.\\nJava and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools.\\nTypescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies.\\nPython for data processing and analysis.\\nPalantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3.\\nOur Principles\\nImpact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.\\nDedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\\nCollaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists.

       "      <td>At HRT, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. We make the world's markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.\\n\\nAlgo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT's trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don't mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.\\n\\nOur environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company's Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.\\n\\nWe are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that's probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java.\\n\\nHere are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:\\n\\n\\nWhen he's not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David's writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like \"one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays\". He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.\\nKai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.\\nAaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates' happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.\\n\\nCulture:\\nHudson River Trading (HRT) brings a scientific approach to trading financial products. We have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments for research and development. Our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.\\n\\nAt HRT we come from all sorts of backgrounds: mathematics, computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering. We're a community of self-starters who are motivated by the excitement of being at the cutting edge of automated trading. Our culture celebrates great ideas whether they come from HRT veterans or new hires. At HRT we're friends and colleagues, whether we are sharing a meal, playing the latest board game, or writing elegant code. We embrace a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.\\n\\nSeem like something you might be interested in? Our goal is to find the best people and bring them together to do great work in a place where everyone is valued. HRT is proud of our diverse staff; we have offices all over the globe and benefit from our varied and unique perspectives. HRT is an equal opportunity employer; so whoever you are we'd love to get to know you.</td>\n",

We work together and are always learning.\\nWe are excited to consider a remote engineer for this role in the Pacific Standard Time zone. If you are not in the PST zone, you must be willing to work within our normal office hours. Remote team members will be expected to work out of their home office and must have successfully worked remotely before.\\nWhat's Interesting About This Job\\nOur code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications. While we have no control over the hosts and environments our agent runs in, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.\\nOur agent needs to slip into these varied environments, into an application, and figure out where the interesting bits are. There it sits, tiny and silent, gathering timings and other data to give our customers visibility into the real performance of their apps.\\nWe write code for the wild, and it is not easy. But we have been doing this for years, and would love to share what we’ve discovered. Ideally, you have things to teach us, too.\\nWhat You'll Do\\nYou will help us build and maintain the Ruby Agent and other data collection software for the Ruby community.\\nYou will write tests. With our comprehensive test suite, we make sure everything we ship is well tested. We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure each release is thoroughly tested and dependable.\\nYou will support our agent, assisting our Technical Support Engineers. We take support rotations where we help customers solve issues and get the most of the agent. We come away from these rotations with ideas of how we can improve our agent to serve our customers better.\\nWhile our team charter is well-defined and fairly narrow, we still have quite a diversity of tasks.\\nTeam Traits\\nAccountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.\\nAttention to detail: We do excellent work every time, and help each other strive for this excellence.\\nRuby expertise: We write Ruby code that metaprograms our customers' Ruby code, and which has to run on multiple versions of Ruby and JRuby.\\nTeamwork: We work closely together and believe in the power of pairing. It’s a great way of sharing information and ensuring quality. And it’s more fun!\\nStrong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.\\n“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.\\nYour Qualifications\\nMust-have:\\nExperience writing efficient Ruby. Customers run our code in their production systems. In order to keep our footprint light, we are on the lookout for unnecessary object allocations and overly complex code.\\nExperience reading through source code for popular libraries, find out how they work, and find the best places to hook our instrumentation code into them.\\nExperience writing comprehensive tests.\\nNot Sure If This Is You?\\nWe are particularly interested in having a diverse team, with a broad set of skills and viewpoints.
