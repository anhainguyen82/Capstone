Throughout the summer you will pair program on production teams where you will learn from and teach your teammates and practice test-driven development to create high-quality, maintainable software. The code you write will contribute to our codebase and actually be deployed into production.\\n\\nWe are looking for smart, tenacious, and outgoing individuals who are looking to challenge themselves and for a highly collaborative environment.\\n\\nAs a part of our company culture we encourage everyone to work a healthy, sustainable pace and that includes interns.

Yet Gatsby’s surface area is so large that the #1 request from the community is still for more and better documentation.\\n\\nWhy this is interesting\\nGatsby’s Learning team is shaping the future of web through documentation and best practice examples; bringing React, Node.js and GraphQL to the content web; setting new standards for website performance and accessibility; and showing the potential of “content mesh” in integrating data sources.\\n\\nTens of thousands of users use Gatsby to build beautiful, performant sites every month. The Learning team are guides for these users.\\n\\nWhat you’ll do on a day-to-day basis\\nAs a Learning team member, your work will mostly be a mix of four things:\\n\\nCreate targeted, methodical documentation. We’ve identified key learning workflows to help people of all skill levels build Gatsby sites, and you’ll be tweaking and sometimes overhauling these. You’ll think carefully about key user types and creating written content, example code &amp; repos, and audiovisual material to address their needs.\\n\\nWork with the community and create community-driven documentation. We keep our pulse on the pain points the community is experiencing in order to guide our work. Perhaps a thread on Twitter reveals a patchy article that can be cleaned up with a couple hours of work and thought. In addition, much of Gatsby’s functionality is driven by the community via the plugin ecosystem. The documentation should provide an up-to-date, helpful overview of community plugins available in a given area and direct the user to further resources, even as the ecosystem rapidly grows richer.\\n\\nProvide documentation-related development. We’ve been focused recently on the thousand little details that go into a beautiful and accessible UI — from a nested sidebar that expands and remembers where you are, to floating table of contents, feedback box, next/previous buttons at the bottom, breadcrumbs, a dedicated search page, and so on. We’re soon going to be crossing the boundary to creating next-generation developer documentation — allowing users to automatically track their learning journey as they complete Gatsby tutorials, bootstrapping a test suite from human-readable docs, and so on.\\nSupport other Gatsby teams. Other teams at Gatsby, such as core (Open Source) and themes, are quickly shipping features. Everyone is expected to document their feature\\nso they contribute documentation PRs, and the Learning team works with them to polish them, flesh them out, help them get merged, and create additional, richer material as necessary.\\nIn addition, you will\\nStreamline and simplify. Like code, sometimes the best documentation PRs remove more lines than they add. Especially with much of the documentation contributed by independent community efforts, it can he helpful to constantly ask if docs should be combined or culled.\\nHelp people contribute to open source. The docs are often the easiest and most accessible way for Gatsby users to give back\\nand that open source is great for developers — the learning team is in a position to facilitate positive experiences.\\nBring novel ideas to the table. New techniques. A great new library you’ve had your eye on. Insightful feedback on other learning and ecosystem improvements.\\nShare your expertise with others—internally and in the Gatsby community. As the Gatsby team grows, you’ll have mentorship opportunities as well.\\nExperience and skills you should have\\nThe Learning team is composed of people with skills in multiple areas: content, development, and collaboration.\\n\\nContent\\n\\nA track record of producing high-quality, written technical communication. Whether produced for your personal blog, or for a company (externally or internally), you’ve spent significant amounts of time writing deeply technical material for a technologist audience. You also should enjoy writing. A big part of creating high-quality documentation is a team that takes pride in tightly crafted content. You have to care.\\nAbility to dive into complex problems and corpuses of text. Norris numbers apply to content, not just codebases. Writing three good paragraphs is significantly less complex than writing a comprehensive essay, which is significantly less complex than writing a five-part series, which is significantly less complex than writing a book. For this role we’re looking for demonstrated aptitude somewhere between “comprehensive essay” and “five-part series” (more is a big plus!). With that experience, you should be able to quickly assess, understand, and iterate upon aspects of our docs codebase.\\nAbility to adjust learning content for a specific audience or outcome. Gatsby has docs in multiple types and formats, each accommodating a different learning style or skill level.\\nDevelopment\\n\\nProfessional experience shipping production code and solving user/customer problems. We’ll have to build for new platforms (an Electron app on the desktop!) and create materials in new formats as our ambitions and standards continue to rise.\\nBuilding websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Appreciation of all of the working parts of the Web Platform would help you write better docs for people who aren’t yet familiar with Gatsby’s way of doing things.\\nA desire to work in the modern JavaScript ecosystem. Gatsby is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies like Node.js, GraphQL, React, webpack, and Babel.\\nCollaboration\\n\\nExperience editing content produced by others (technical or non-technical) . Perhaps you’ve taken a bunch of assorted READMEs and crafted them into an onboarding guide. Perhaps you spontaneously take a red pen to friends’ essays or blog posts. Perhaps you notice yourself editing Google Docs sent out by colleagues to make them more clear.\\nStrong personal communication skills. As part of our Learning team, you’d both directly and indirectly interface with community members. Clear, friendly, and professional communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources.\\nReady and willing to ask and answer questions. If you’re comfortable saying you’re unsure, asking for help, and reaching out to assist others, you’ll be an incredible addition to our team. Our team thrives because of continuous learning and a willingness to work together.\\nExperience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required\\nYou have done public speaking, developer advocacy, or teaching. On the Gatsby learning team, we often have opportunities to present on Gatsby topics at conferences and workshops. While the opportunity to grow into this skillset will still be there, experience as a public speaker would help you ramp up faster. Experience recording development screencasts is also helpful.\\nYou have a passion for web accessibility. As maintainers of a website framework, we have an opportunity to make the web more inclusive and accessible for everyone. Previous experience with accessible web development and content creation would help you to stand out from other candidates.\\nYou have maintained documentation in an active repository before. Maybe you’ve helped maintain a popular open source repo, or maybe you’ve worked on internal repos that saw contributions from multiple teams. Previous experience with highly active repo workflows is a definite plus for this role.\\nThe best parts of this job\\nYou’ll be empowered to propose ideas for new learning content and ecosystem improvements for key learning workflows.\\nYou’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site building frameworks on the market, digging into the Gatsby’s innovatively architected docs system and codebase, using modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL.\\nYou’ll be part of an active, open, friendly community of developers that are really excited about building high-performance, fun-to-use websites.\\nYou’ll be working in a safe, open environment of talented engineers who have a broad range of experience.\\nYour role will be key to making Gatsby the next way to build on the web — and a technology that is accessible to the next billion internet users.\\nThe worst parts of this job\\nAs the Learning team for a fast-paced startup, we are often tasked with supporting multiple teams for product launches and events. This requires balancing priorities and working together to ensure we’re working on things that provide the most value.\\nIn open source, you’re faced with a nonstop stream of issues and pull requests. That means you need to develop an intuition of how to prioritize tasks for Learning/Core team needs and those from the community.\\nWhen working in the open–including fielding user feedback on social media–it can sometimes be difficult to remain professional when things don’t go as planned. Gatsby team members are expected to act as bridges between communities even when it’s hard, because we’re all better off for it.\\nBenefits you will receive\\n3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement\\nUnlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time\\nAmazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)\\nSkip the commute with remote work\\nFly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups\\nStock options in a fast-growing startup\\nGatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure\\nOur Hiring Process\\nGatsby is an equal opportunity employer. We eagerly seek applicants of diverse backgrounds and hire without regard to race, color, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical abilities (or disability), age, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Cultivating inclusivity and diversity is a top priority.\\n\\nHeadhunters and recruitment agencies may not submit resumes/CVs through this website or directly to managers. Gatsby does not accept unsolicited headhunter and agency resumes, and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with Gatsby.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SigOpt provides a scalable, high availability platform for tuning machine learning model parameters. We're looking for curious and enthusiastic interns to learn, grow, and build with us!\\n\\nChallenges\\nInterns work as core parts of the team: attending and presenting at meetings, scoping and documenting projects, regularly releasing production code. Past interns have added core features like Metric Thresholds, Multimetric API, Metric Minimization, and experiment search. They’ve written our Getting Started demo, built our configuration manager on Zookeeper, and written our guide for reinforcement learning with SigOpt.\\n\\nTo make this happen, interns will need to:\\n\\nOwn Projects: You’ll have a lot of responsibility over the scope and implementation of your projects. You won’t find any toy projects here! Interns work on critical pieces of our infrastructure and algorithms. Communicating with the team to give and receive feedback is an essential part of the internship.\\n\\nWork with New Technologies: We expect interns to be able to quickly ramp up on the languages and platforms we use. You don’t have to be an expert before you join, but we’ll coach you to be a strong, independent contributor on our stack by the end of the term.\\n\\nExtend our API: Our customers constantly tell us how intuitive and reliable our API is. As we make our service more sophisticated, you’ll be ensuring that customers can still quickly integrate SigOpt into their workflows. Potential projects include building new RESTful endpoints and resources that connect customer needs with the research team’s algorithms.\\n\\nBuild Out Web App: Another project area interns work on is our React-based interface for managing and analyzing experiments. Data visualization, user management, and experiment tracking are all critical pieces of the SigOpt solution that interns extend.\\n\\nUse the Best Tools: Kubernetes, Postgres, Node, Python 3, GitHub, PagerDuty, Slack. We make sure our developers have everything they need to do their best work. You'll need to be curious, and ramp up on new tools. These skills will make you a more effective engineer long term; they are worth the effort!\\nRequirements\\nEngineering internship or professional experience\\nStrong programming ability it at least one language\\nAbility to help develop end-to-end solutions for real world problems\\nPluses\\nDevelopment of services on cloud infrastructure\\nWeb design or UX background\\nUnderstanding of database usage such as Postgres or MySQL\\nMachine Learning experience to empathize with customers\\nBenefits\\nSalary and relocation packages\\nCatered lunches and office snacks\\nTeam and Company off-sites and team building activities\\nHealthy work-life balance - we expect our co-ops to enjoy their time at the office as well as outside of work\\nBased in downtown San Francisco, tech hub of the world\\nWorking at SigOpt\\nSigOpt empowers experts to build world-class models through an API and web app. By designing solutions that automate model optimization, SigOpt accelerates the impact of experimentation on machine learning, deep learning, simulation and other AI models. You can see examples of our work with Two Sigma, MLConf,NVidia.\\n\\nOur simple API makes suggestions to customers about different versions of their model to try, and aggregates the results for browsing and analysis. On the backend, we run asynchronous computations to build our own predictions of what's going to help the customer's model perform the best.\\n\\nEngineers are empowered to make big decisions about what they're working on and how they want to ship it. We have thorough test coverage through unit, integration, and functional tests. Code reviews are standard practice and help our engineers build their coding and communication skills.\\n\\nValues\\nWe're looking for interns who enjoy taking responsibility for shipping great features that delight our customers. Our values:\\n\\nEmpowerment: Take ownership and make bold decisions\\nCuriosity: Be a humble teacher and active student\\nRespect: Foster an inclusive, diverse and safe environment for everyone\\nBalance: Know when to work, when to play and when to go home\\nSolidarity: Transparently collaborate toward shared goals\\n\\nWe're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\nMomentum\\nWe're set up for success: SigOpt is supported by leading investors from Andreessen Horowitz, Two Sigma, Y Combinator, SV Angel, Blumberg Capital, and In-Q-Tel, and has earned awards from O'Reilly, Barclay's, CB Insights, and Gartner.

Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list.\\n\\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!\\n\\nAbout the Department\\n\\nCloudflare's Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles a large number of HTTP requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world's largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.\\n\\nWhat you'll do\\n\\nCloudflare is looking for a backend engineer to help us build and maintain the codebase that powers both our customer APIs as well as internal service APIs. This is a role for engineers that are familiar with standard web backend architecture, and capable in database design and interaction. Our API platform is under constant load and scrutiny, so experience and commitment to easily understood and tested code is also a key part of the role. Your ability to visualize the flow of data through a complex application is critical to your success, and to the team's. You will be working closely with the product team to understand and document the functional needs of their product requirements, developing new code to solve new problems, as well as maintaining existing code to squash bugs. Our web stack is based on PHP, Redis, and Postgres, but you'll also need to consider the nature of REST APIs, database management, and deployment workflows. Knowledge of PHP is not a must, but deep familiarity with web favored languages is (Python, Ruby, Golang).\\n\\nExamples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience\\n\\n\\n5+ years of experience building large-scale software applications\\nExperience designing and integrating RESTful APIs\\nKnowledge of SQL and common relational database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL\\nExcellent debugging and optimization skills\\nUnit/integration testing experience\\nExperience using backend web frameworks\\n\\nBonus Points\\n\\n\\nFamiliarity with containerization development workflows\\nFamiliarity with PostgreSQL stored procedure development\\n\\nWhat Makes Us Special\\n\\nWe're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\\n\\nProject Galileo ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/ ): We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.\\n\\nProject Athenian ( https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/ ): We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\\n\\nPath Forward Partnership ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/ ): Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\\n\\nWe released1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by ourprivacy policy ( https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ ) and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\\n\\nSound like something you'd like to be a part of?

       "3    Gatsby’s Learning team is looking for a software engineer to help learners of all skill levels enjoy the experience of making sites with Gatsby.\\nAbout Us\\nGatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, accessible, and astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source. Our core values include transparency (our work is public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.\\n\\nDetails of the Role\\nType of Work: Full-time employee\\nLocation: Remote (Preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4)\\nEngineering Level: Staff L5/L6\\nWhy we’re hiring\\nGatsby is growing fast, and we need help improving Gatsby’s learning experience to help it realize its potential!\\n\\nWe’ve invested heavily in documentation, with 800+ pages worth of documentation & a beautiful and intuitive UI (if we do say so ourselves!). Yet Gatsby’s surface area is so large that the #1 request from the community is still for more and better documentation.\\n\\nWhy this is interesting\\nGatsby’s Learning team is shaping the future of web through documentation and best practice examples; bringing React, Node.js and GraphQL to the content web; setting new standards for website performance and accessibility; and showing the potential of “content mesh” in integrating data sources.\\n\\nTens of thousands of users use Gatsby to build beautiful, performant sites every month. The Learning team are guides for these users.\\n\\nWhat you’ll do on a day-to-day basis\\nAs a Learning team member, your work will mostly be a mix of four things:\\n\\nCreate targeted, methodical documentation. We’ve identified key learning workflows to help people of all skill levels build Gatsby sites, and you’ll be tweaking and sometimes overhauling these. You’ll think carefully about key user types and creating written content, example code & repos, and audiovisual material to address their needs.\\n\\nWork with the community and create community-driven documentation. We keep our pulse on the pain points the community is experiencing in order to guide our work. Perhaps a thread on Twitter reveals a patchy article that can be cleaned up with a couple hours of work and thought. In addition, much of Gatsby’s functionality is driven by the community via the plugin ecosystem. The documentation should provide an up-to-date, helpful overview of community plugins available in a given area and direct the user to further resources, even as the ecosystem rapidly grows richer.\\n\\nProvide documentation-related development. We’ve been focused recently on the thousand little details that go into a beautiful and accessible UI — from a nested sidebar that expands and remembers where you are, to floating table of contents, feedback box, next/previous buttons at the bottom, breadcrumbs, a dedicated search page, and so on. We’re soon going to be crossing the boundary to creating next-generation developer documentation — allowing users to automatically track their learning journey as they complete Gatsby tutorials, bootstrapping a test suite from human-readable docs, and so on.\\nSupport other Gatsby teams. Other teams at Gatsby, such as core (Open Source) and themes, are quickly shipping features. Everyone is expected to document their feature\\nso they contribute documentation PRs, and the Learning team works with them to polish them, flesh them out, help them get merged, and create additional, richer material as necessary.\\nIn addition, you will\\nStreamline and simplify. Like code, sometimes the best documentation PRs remove more lines than they add. Especially with much of the documentation contributed by independent community efforts, it can he helpful to constantly ask if docs should be combined or culled.\\nHelp people contribute to open source. The docs are often the easiest and most accessible way for Gatsby users to give back\\nand that open source is great for developers — the learning team is in a position to facilitate positive experiences.\\nBring novel ideas to the table. New techniques. A great new library you’ve had your eye on. Insightful feedback on other learning and ecosystem improvements.\\nShare your expertise with others—internally and in the Gatsby community. As the Gatsby team grows, you’ll have mentorship opportunities as well.\\nExperience and skills you should have\\nThe Learning team is composed of people with skills in multiple areas: content, development, and collaboration.\\n\\nContent\\n\\nA track record of producing high-quality, written technical communication. Whether produced for your personal blog, or for a company (externally or internally), you’ve spent significant amounts of time writing deeply technical material for a technologist audience. You also should enjoy writing. A big part of creating high-quality documentation is a team that takes pride in tightly crafted content. You have to care.\\nAbility to dive into complex problems and corpuses of text. Norris numbers apply to content, not just codebases. Writing three good paragraphs is significantly less complex than writing a comprehensive essay, which is significantly less complex than writing a five-part series, which is significantly less complex than writing a book. For this role we’re looking for demonstrated aptitude somewhere between “comprehensive essay” and “five-part series” (more is a big plus!). With that experience, you should be able to quickly assess, understand, and iterate upon aspects of our docs codebase.\\nAbility to adjust learning content for a specific audience or outcome. Gatsby has docs in multiple types and formats, each accommodating a different learning style or skill level.\\nDevelopment\\n\\nProfessional experience shipping production code and solving user/customer problems. We’ll have to build for new platforms (an Electron app on the desktop!) and create materials in new formats as our ambitions and standards continue to rise.\\nBuilding websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Appreciation of all of the working parts of the Web Platform would help you write better docs for people who aren’t yet familiar with Gatsby’s way of doing things.\\nA desire to work in the modern JavaScript ecosystem. Gatsby is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies like Node.js, GraphQL, React, webpack, and Babel.\\nCollaboration\\n\\nExperience editing content produced by others (technical or non-technical) . Perhaps you’ve taken a bunch of assorted READMEs and crafted them into an onboarding guide. Perhaps you spontaneously take a red pen to friends’ essays or blog posts. Perhaps you notice yourself editing Google Docs sent out by colleagues to make them more clear.\\nStrong personal communication skills. As part of our Learning team, you’d both directly and indirectly interface with community members. Clear, friendly, and professional communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources.\\nReady and willing to ask and answer questions. If you’re comfortable saying you’re unsure, asking for help, and reaching out to assist others, you’ll be an incredible addition to our team. Our team thrives because of continuous learning and a willingness to work together.\\nExperience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required\\nYou have done public speaking, developer advocacy, or teaching. On the Gatsby learning team, we often have opportunities to present on Gatsby topics at conferences and workshops. While the opportunity to grow into this skillset will still be there, experience as a public speaker would help you ramp up faster. Experience recording development screencasts is also helpful.\\nYou have a passion for web accessibility. As maintainers of a website framework, we have an opportunity to make the web more inclusive and accessible for everyone. Previous experience with accessible web development and content creation would help you to stand out from other candidates.\\nYou have maintained documentation in an active repository before. Maybe you’ve helped maintain a popular open source repo, or maybe you’ve worked on internal repos that saw contributions from multiple teams. Previous experience with highly active repo workflows is a definite plus for this role.\\nThe best parts of this job\\nYou’ll be empowered to propose ideas for new learning content and ecosystem improvements for key learning workflows.\\nYou’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site building frameworks on the market, digging into the Gatsby’s innovatively architected docs system and codebase, using modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL.\\nYou’ll be part of an active, open, friendly community of developers that are really excited about building high-performance, fun-to-use websites.\\nYou’ll be working in a safe, open environment of talented engineers who have a broad range of experience.\\nYour role will be key to making Gatsby the next way to build on the web — and a technology that is accessible to the next billion internet users.\\nThe worst parts of this job\\nAs the Learning team for a fast-paced startup, we are often tasked with supporting multiple teams for product launches and events. This requires balancing priorities and working together to ensure we’re working on things that provide the most value.\\nIn open source, you’re faced with a nonstop stream of issues and pull requests. That means you need to develop an intuition of how to prioritize tasks for Learning/Core team needs and those from the community.\\nWhen working in the open–including fielding user feedback on social media–it can sometimes be difficult to remain professional when things don’t go as planned. Gatsby team members are expected to act as bridges between communities even when it’s hard, because we’re all better off for it.\\nBenefits you will receive\\n3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement\\nUnlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time\\nAmazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)\\nSkip the commute with remote work\\nFly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups\\nStock options in a fast-growing startup\\nGatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure\\nOur Hiring Process\\nGatsby is an equal opportunity employer. We eagerly seek applicants of diverse backgrounds and hire without regard to race, color, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical abilities (or disability), age, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Cultivating inclusivity and diversity is a top priority.\\n\\nHeadhunters and recruitment agencies may not submit resumes/CVs through this website or directly to managers. Gatsby does not accept unsolicited headhunter and agency resumes, and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with Gatsby.  \n",

       "241  About Us\\n\\nAt Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list.\\n\\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!\\n\\nAbout the Department\\n\\nCloudflare's Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles a large number of HTTP requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world's largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.\\n\\nWhat you'll do\\n\\nCloudflare is looking for a backend engineer to help us build and maintain the codebase that powers both our customer APIs as well as internal service APIs. This is a role for engineers that are familiar with standard web backend architecture, and capable in database design and interaction. Our API platform is under constant load and scrutiny, so experience and commitment to easily understood and tested code is also a key part of the role. Your ability to visualize the flow of data through a complex application is critical to your success, and to the team's. You will be working closely with the product team to understand and document the functional needs of their product requirements, developing new code to solve new problems, as well as maintaining existing code to squash bugs. Our web stack is based on PHP, Redis, and Postgres, but you'll also need to consider the nature of REST APIs, database management, and deployment workflows. Knowledge of PHP is not a must, but deep familiarity with web favored languages is (Python, Ruby, Golang).\\n\\nExamples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience\\n\\n\\n5+ years of experience building large-scale software applications\\nExperience designing and integrating RESTful APIs\\nKnowledge of SQL and common relational database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL\\nExcellent debugging and optimization skills\\nUnit/integration testing experience\\nExperience using backend web frameworks\\n\\nBonus Points\\n\\n\\nFamiliarity with containerization development workflows\\nFamiliarity with PostgreSQL stored procedure development\\n\\nWhat Makes Us Special\\n\\nWe're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\\n\\nProject Galileo ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/ ): We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.\\n\\nProject Athenian ( https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/ ): We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\\n\\nPath Forward Partnership ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/ ): Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\\n\\nWe released1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by ourprivacy policy ( https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ ) and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\\n\\nSound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!\\n\\nCloudflare hires the best people based on an evaluation of their abilities and effectiveness. We don't discriminate against employees on the basis of any other personal characteristic or any classification protected by federal, state or local law.
