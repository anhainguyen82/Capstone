15,Software Engineer,"Austin, TX",Austin,TX,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Company Overview
The Cognito platform from Vectra provides continuous, automated threat surveillance to proactively expose hidden and unknown cyberattackers that actively spread inside networks.

The genesis of Cognito is based on a simple principle for finding hidden threats: use an authoritative source of data and seek out the fundamental threat behaviors that cybercriminals can’t avoid when they carry out an attack.

To do this, Cognito relies on the only source of truth during a cyberattack – network traffic. Only traffic on the wire – whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments – reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence. Low-fidelity perimeter security only shows what you’ve already seen, not the hidden attacks that were missed.

Cognito delivers a far more efficient way of analyzing network traffic at scale. Instead of traditional payload inspection, it uses AI, machine learning and behavioral traffic analysis to expose the fundamental behaviors of attackers as they spy, spread, and steal in the network – even in encrypted traffic. By automating cyberattacker detection, analysis and incident response, Cognito AI condenses days or weeks of work into minutes, reducing the threat investigation workload. For more details, see https://vectra.ai/how-it-works.

Position Overview
The Vectra Engineering team is a small and constantly growing team of individuals. We look for people that are smart, very capable technically, and have fun solving the challenges that our customers face together as a team. We believe strongly that everyone can and should have significant impacts on the growth of the product as well as the company and our culture. We believe in using the right technology for each problem and building knowledge through mentorship and other things like peer code reviews. We're excited to find others to join the team that want to work on an interesting product that solves real problems.

We're focused on bringing quality interface design to Vectra's suite of applications that run on the Cognito platform. You will have full exposure to the UI stack with a focus on building features for enterprise-level applications. This includes taking large complex data sets and creating easily understood and insightful visualizations and reports.

Responsibilities
As a Software Engineer here at Vectra you'll have the opportunity to work on different areas of the overall engineering team: the Cognito Platform, the Detect Application, the Stream Application, and our Cloud offering. Each of these teams will generally require you to:

Understand modern web app architecture and be able to develop features in languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++
Implement the Python-based customer-facing REST APIs.
Apply knowledge of relational and non-relational databases to model customers’ networks and active security threats.

Deploy Algorithmia Enterprise into Fortune 500 and Government environments
Design, build, and maintain the automation and infrastructure needed to deliver Algorithmia effectively, and to help us achieve even greater scale
Work cross-team to ensure Algoritmia supports unique customer environments, and to design solutions to meet specific customer needs

Have a real career plan, with mentorship and fast-track opportunities to promotion, technical leadership, people management, or wherever your interests may be
Work from anywhere in the USA or Canada. We have teams in Seattle, NYC, Vancouver BC, Nova Scotia - or go 100% remote from home (Snuggie, bunny slippers, and all - no judgement!)

Have experience multiple languages (Java, Scala, Go, Python, Bash, etc.), deployment tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, etc.), and cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack, etc.)
Are passionate about automation, and believe nothing should ever be done manually twice
Enjoy working with customers to deliver solutions that meet business need, empower engineers (and data scientists!), and solve real-world problems
Feel most comfortable in hybrid roles that blur the line between Developer, Site Reliability Engineer, Deployment Engineer, Solutions Architect, and Consultant
Bonus points for a love of data science, any kind of AI/ML experience, interesting public code, or the implementation of something cool on our AI marketplace (hint: free trial!)

As a Software Engineer at Algorithmia you'll join a passionate team that's changing the way everyone uses AI and ML. You'll solve real problems, make an impact, and work in a flexible environment that encourages you to follow your own interests as well.

Be proficient in Python and/or Golang.
Proficient with Git.
Good understanding of best-practices around API design (REST, GraphQL)
