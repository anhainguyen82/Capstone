Techs on the beach
On April 14, 1981, in Honolulu, Hawaii, William “Bill” Melton incorporated his new tech company. The original intention was to provide a recourse for retailers who’d been swindled by people handing out bad checks. Bill's product was a kind of verification device using phone lines—a verification phone.
But then a pivot. The credit card industry was relatively new at the time and processing was still being done with carbon paper. Bill saw a way to reduce costs for companies like Visa and MasterCard, while capitalizing on this new technology. Instead of verifying checks, we would provide local businesses a means to electronically process credit card payments. And thus, the Verifone payment device was born.
Now, Verifone is one of the world’s largest POS terminal vendors and a leading provider of payment and commerce solutions. We operate in more than 150 countries and employ nearly 6,000 people globally. Our steady growth has come organically, through a dedication to innovation and strategic partnerships, as well as from savvy acquisitions.
""We believe great work comes from incredible people. We’ve established a team with dedication to committed support and unmatched expertise. Whether it’s building significant client experiences or paving the way for the future breakthrough in payment technology, Verifone is a place where growing your career means making a global impact.

We’re changing the way that car insurance works. We’re competing with companies that have been around for a century and comprise a $200B industry—and we’re doing it with an astonishingly small team. We're building an Engineering Team in Chicago that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, so we're searching for experienced Software Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch.

Our tech stack includes:
Ruby / Rails backend, RSpec for testing
Javascript / React Native frontend, Mocha for testing
Small amounts of native iOS and Android

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company:

Our team excels at delivering software to build Root’s products: presently, mobile apps and a backend platform for personal auto insurance. We’ve shaped our team and our way of working around this. Our engineering team would not be the most transformative team at building a mobile operating system. We’d be quite bad at that. We’re exceptionally good at building the type of software that is necessary to invoke change in the insurance industry.

For more information on engineering at Root see https://eng.joinroot.com/

We divide the areas of responsibility for engineers into three major areas:
Technical: The skills and knowledge that make up an engineer’s basic problem-solving toolbox.

About CloudQuant
The explosion of alternative data, machine learning and big data technology have spawned a revolution in systematic and fundamental investing. As systematic investors descend from the clouds of purely statistical analysis and encroach upon the terrain formerly occupied exclusively by fundamental analysts, it creates an evolutionary show-down between fundamental and systematic investors which will take place at the quantamental investment cross-roads. This is where legions from both camps will utilize, in different ways, the alternative data to capture the finite amount of alpha in the world. CloudQuant is the vanguard of this revolution, providing the technology tools and business intelligence consulting services with the only full-stack solution encompassing trading, research, visualization, data science, business analytics, and a point-in-time data access fabric, which will be critical weapons as the search for alpha accelerates. As the systematic investors descend on fundamental catalysts and fundamental investors unleash their insights with more granular alternative datasets it is our mission to provide analytical tools that make a critical difference in this evolutionary endgame in investing.
We use visualization, data science, advanced data APIs, and artificial intelligence. We use alternative data, fundamental data, proprietary data, crowdsourcing, high-resolution backtesting, and high-frequency trading engines. We use Python Notebooks, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing to prove the alpha signals and value in the alternative data sets.
We began as an internal research tool for professional proprietary and systematic traders with extraordinary trading ideas to be able to explore quantitative trading ideas within a trading firm.
In 2016, CloudQuant was established as a stand-alone Technology and Business Analytics firm aimed at serving the needs of the independent market researchers around the world. Today our site attracts people from over 170 countries.
CloudQuant is:
a data showcase for alternative data vendors,
a provider of business analytics tools and services,
a high-performance quantitative research and trading platform,
an educator,
a community for traders, quants, and data scientists,
an investor in profitable strategies
a PaaS technology provider,

About the Unit
We are a startup incubated at the TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health at the University of Chicago, and supported by Schmidt Futures. We’re a rapidly growing team creating technical solutions for pressing challenges in early childhood development. We’re looking for talented individuals who enjoy building and delivering high-quality products. If you’re excited to develop technology for social good, come join us! We’re seeking a highly motivated, hands-on signal processing engineer. You will lead the design and implementation of algorithms on-the-cloud capable of accurately detecting and categorizing adult and child speech. This is a full-time position, but contractor relationships may be considered. We’re based in NYC and Chicago, and remote-friendly. Project Background: Our team’s mission is to give all children an equal opportunity to reach their fullest cognitive potential. Research shows that the most critical window for a child’s brain and language development is from birth to age 3. The most important predictor of a child’s educational success is the quality and quantity of adult-child interactions during these earliest years. Parents need tools that guide them through this formative time period. Our goal is to develop scalable, easy-to-use wearable devices that measure conversational interactions and empower parents. Our product is like a ‘Fitbit’ for early childhood language development - it attaches to a child’s clothing and gathers information about the number of words children are exposed to. It’s connected to a smartphone app that provides feedback to parents and other caregivers on progress and how to improve. The Team: You’ll be joining a talented and enthusiastic team of computer scientists, early childhood development researchers, and experts in security, privacy, and design. We’re supported by the Schmidt Futures network, a community of distinguished figures in technology, including Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and Executive Chairman of Alphabet. The visionary behind this project is Dana Suskind, MD, a pediatric surgeon turned social scientist and author of the 2015 book ‘Thirty Million Words: Building a Child’s Brain’. She co-directs the TMW Center, where she is advancing a novel public health approach that empowers parents to influence their children’s language and cognitive development. Dana’s work has been profiled by numerous media outlets, including the New York Times, The Economist, Forbes, NPR and Freakonomics among others. Our technical advisory team includes: Pedro Lopes is a technical advisor for wearable device development. He is an Assistant Professor at UChicago, where he leads a research group focused on human computer interaction and wearable computing. Nick Feamster is Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Center for Data and Computing at UChicago, and an advisor on security and privacy for IoT devices. Marshini Chetty is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UChicago. Her focus is advising on human computer interaction, IoT devices, and building technology for empowerment. Ben Zhao is a technical advisor and Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at UChicago. His current research covers a range of topics including adversarial machine learning, data-driven models of user behavior, and privacy-preserving mobile and wireless systems. Heather Zheng: Heather is the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. Heather is a technical advisor on mobile computing and networking. John List: John is a UChicago economist and Chief Economic Advisor at Lyft, known for pioneering field experiments to test economic theory and to provide guidance to policymakers and business leaders. We are looking for an engineer who can lead algorithm development to upgrade the existing device to capture ‘conversational turns’ between parents and children.

Fast Radius is the leading provider of additive manufacturing solutions, including application discovery, product design and testing, and production-grade manufacturing. From entirely new products uniquely enabled by additive manufacturing to global supply chain solutions leveraging a virtual warehouse, Fast Radius brings the future of manufacturing and the supply chain to its clients. Last year, Fast Radius was recognized as one of the 9 companies best “implementing technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution” by the World Economic Forum (WEF)—the only company honored that is based in North America. Fast Radius is headquartered in Chicago, with offices in Atlanta, Ga and Singapore, as well as a production hub on-site at the UPS Worldport facility in Louisville, Ky. Visit www.fastradius.com for additional information.

Why Software is Important To Us:

Fast Radius is fundamentally a data driven organization. From how we print our parts to how we interact with our clients, we believe that everything we do can be done better if we understand our processes and parts better. In order to achieve that goal we can’t use off the shelf order and part management systems. We know they end up creating data silos and slow you down in the long run. In order to build the manufacturing network of the future we need a custom software platform designed specifically for our company. We need a platform that integrates our sales process with our order tracking processes and finally with our plant so that we can have a complete real time understanding of how our business operates and how each independent process affects the parts we produce. We can’t do that without building our own tools.

About the Unit
We are a startup incubated at the TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health at the University of Chicago, and supported by Schmidt Futures. We’re a rapidly growing team creating technical solutions for pressing challenges in early childhood development. We’re looking for talented individuals who enjoy building and delivering high-quality products. If you’re excited to develop technology for social good, come join us! We’re seeking a highly motivated, hands-on signal processing engineer. You will lead the design and implementation of algorithms on-the-cloud capable of accurately detecting and categorizing adult and child speech. This is a full-time position, but contractor relationships may be considered. We’re based in NYC and Chicago, and remote-friendly. Project Background: Our team’s mission is to give all children an equal opportunity to reach their fullest cognitive potential. Research shows that the most critical window for a child’s brain and language development is from birth to age 3. The most important predictor of a child’s educational success is the quality and quantity of adult-child interactions during these earliest years. Parents need tools that guide them through this formative time period. Our goal is to develop scalable, easy-to-use wearable devices that measure conversational interactions and empower parents. Our product is like a ‘Fitbit’ for early childhood language development - it attaches to a child’s clothing and gathers information about the number of words children are exposed to. It’s connected to a smartphone app that provides feedback to parents and other caregivers on progress and how to improve. The Team: You’ll be joining a talented and enthusiastic team of computer scientists, early childhood development researchers, and experts in security, privacy, and design. We’re supported by the Schmidt Futures network, a community of distinguished figures in technology, including Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and Executive Chairman of Alphabet. The visionary behind this project is Dana Suskind, MD, a pediatric surgeon turned social scientist and author of the 2015 book ‘Thirty Million Words: Building a Child’s Brain’. She co-directs the TMW Center, where she is advancing a novel public health approach that empowers parents to influence their children’s language and cognitive development. Dana’s work has been profiled by numerous media outlets, including the New York Times, The Economist, Forbes, NPR and Freakonomics among others. Our technical advisory team includes: Pedro Lopes is a technical advisor for wearable device development. He is an Assistant Professor at UChicago, where he leads a research group focused on human computer interaction and wearable computing. Nick Feamster is Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Center for Data and Computing at UChicago, and an advisor on security and privacy for IoT devices. Marshini Chetty is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UChicago. Her focus is advising on human computer interaction, IoT devices, and building technology for empowerment. Ben Zhao is a technical advisor and Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at UChicago. His current research covers a range of topics including adversarial machine learning, data-driven models of user behavior, and privacy-preserving mobile and wireless systems. Heather Zheng: Heather is the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. Heather is a technical advisor on mobile computing and networking. John List: John is a UChicago economist and Chief Economic Advisor at Lyft, known for pioneering field experiments to test economic theory and to provide guidance to policymakers and business leaders. We are looking for an engineer who can lead algorithm development to upgrade the existing device to capture ‘conversational turns’ between parents and children.

About CloudQuant
The explosion of alternative data, machine learning and big data technology have spawned a revolution in systematic and fundamental investing. As systematic investors descend from the clouds of purely statistical analysis and encroach upon the terrain formerly occupied exclusively by fundamental analysts, it creates an evolutionary show-down between fundamental and systematic investors which will take place at the quantamental investment cross-roads. This is where legions from both camps will utilize, in different ways, the alternative data to capture the finite amount of alpha in the world. CloudQuant is the vanguard of this revolution, providing the technology tools and business intelligence consulting services with the only full-stack solution encompassing trading, research, visualization, data science, business analytics, and a point-in-time data access fabric, which will be critical weapons as the search for alpha accelerates.

After a two-week training program covering the fundamentals of our trading systems and engineering principles, you'll join a team of senior engineers tasked with finding elegant solutions to complex problems. You won't just have a chance to contribute, you'll be expected to. After all, the best way to learn is to do.

Technology at Optiver:
As an engineer, you are a maker at heart. And at Optiver you will have the opportunity to take ownership of complex problems and craft solutions—to make stuff—from day one. Every day will bring fresh challenges that demand even fresher thinking. And the proprietary trading systems you build will directly impact financial markets that—either directly or indirectly—touch the lives of millions of people.

What you'll need:

Working towards a BS or MS in Computer Science, or related technical field
Knowledge of algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and systems programming concepts
Experience coding in C++, C#, C, or Java
Ability to communicate and collaborate with developers, traders, and business operations on a daily basis
Excitement to learn options trading and apply this knowledge toward well-crafted solutions
Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required; we will not sponsor individuals for employment authorization for this job opening

Who we are:
Optiver is a leading global electronic market maker specializing in pricing, execution and risk management. Working together, our traders and software engineers design proprietary systems and execute strategies to provide liquidity and increase market efficiencies.

Put simply, we improve the markets. That's not merely an aspiration, but our reason for being. It requires intelligence, obviously. But in this industry, that's table stakes. We're seeking traders, software engineers and interns who up the ante with nerve, with guts and, most importantly, with heart. We're looking for the bold. Does that describe you? Then opt in.


We accept one application per role per year. If you have previously applied to the Software Engineer Intern position during this season and have been unsuccessful, you can reapply once the next recruitment season begins in 2020.
