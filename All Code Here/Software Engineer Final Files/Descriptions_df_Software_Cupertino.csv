0,Software Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA",Sunnyvale,CA,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"A³ by Airbus is the Silicon Valley outpost of Airbus. The mission of Airbus is to make things fly. Our job at A3 is very simple: we seek to disrupt Airbus (and the competition) before anyone else can. And in the process, we are setting out to build the future of flight.

At A³, we execute projects and foster partnerships. Projects are ambitious, risky, time-constrained undertakings that culminate in a demonstration at convincing scale—something that's more than a mere prototype, but somewhat short of a product. One project is focused on advanced digital design and manufacturing processes and tools.

Your role as a Software Engineer will be to assist the Engineering Leads in executing a work package for an A³ project with a focus on speed, quality, and cost. You will need to understand the analytic framework and business case the project is based on and advocate it within groups internal to and external to the project. You will need to be comfortable using supplied data to make informed decisions regarding implementation of software use cases and be comfortable working in an agile work environment, where quick delivery, constant testing, and iteration are the norm. As our projects are ""out-of-the-box"" by design, you will be expected to seek, investigate, and implement creative solutions to challenges and obstacles that emerge. You will use your knowledge and talent as a Software Engineer to implement the software to demonstrate the project's analytic framework.

To get specific, your responsibilities will include:

Develop, document and maintain architectures, requirements, algorithms, interfaces and designs for software systems.
Develop tools and processes to demonstrate the program analytic framework
Contribute from a security and software engineering perspective during design of software systems
Development of code and integration of complex software components into a fully functional system
Creation of software verification plans, test procedures, and test environments, executing test procedures, and documenting the results to ensure software requirements are met
Participation in code and architecture reviews as required
Development of documentation for software written
Aggressively pursue program-specific tasks and issues identified by the Engineering Leads, Project Executive

We expect that you will have:

An undergraduate degree in a technical field and at least 3 years of progressively ambitious work experience and a demonstrated track record in Software Engineering and Testing.
Strong Java or Python development experience
Strong knowledge of web services (JAX, REST) and transfer protocols (HTTP, FTP, SOAP)
Experience in creation of web-accessible Application Programming Interfaces
Experience in creating web services from monolithic applications.
Experience with database design and implementation, more specifically with PostgreSQL
Excellent communication, presenting issues and ideas in a simplified form focusing on importance

In addition, the following skills and qualifications will be an advantage:


Experience in Manufacturing Process Modeling
Software development experience in a production environment
Passion for increasing the productivity of engineering teams
Ability to work under pressure to meet sometimes aggressive deadlines

To succeed in this position, you need to be willing to work with a flexible schedule including travel.

By the way, you might be interested to know that we offer a killer benefits package as well as a flight training benefit, just in case you don't already have your pilot's license!

A³ by Airbus is an equal opportunity employer in every category. The data is incontrovertible that diversity leads to better teams, better performance, and better results. Consequently, we actively seek candidates of all genders, backgrounds, and experiences."

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your congressional representatives and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.

In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.

We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

We are currently accepting applications to join our engineering team. We encourage all qualified applicants, including people of color, gays and lesbians, women, transgender people, veterans, and people with disabilities. We particularly encourage people who are underrepresented in politics and startups to apply. We prioritize equity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity of perspectives and experiences makes our work better.

About the role:
As a software engineer at Change Research, you will play a vital part in building the software that keeps our polling operations running seamlessly. You are curious, data-driven, team-oriented and a go-getter ready to take on a challenge. You are someone who knows when to step up and grab the reins and when to be a team player. You do this in an exceptionally organized and thoughtful way, conscious of ways you can contribute. You are able to evolve over time, driving your own impact and trajectory.

We are a team of engineers who are comfortable wearing multiple hats. We are full-stack developers (backend/frontend) and “full-stack data” engineers (data pipelines and analytics and/or machine learning) and finally managers who code. You don’t have to currently wear multiple hats, but you definitely will develop deep expertise in multiple domains.

As an engineer, you will:
Build
Work on critical infrastructure, tweaking client-facing deliverables, or automating a step in the process that was previously rote or time-consuming in any given sprint.
Code at least 60% of the time. Despite being a startup with many priorities, we understand the costs of context-switching and prefer to focus on shipping features to our clients and customers (pollsters).
You like to test your code and are comfortable doing so
Innovate
Try new things and not afraid to fail. Of course we often re-adjust quickly based on new findings without burning too much resources.
Constantly reinvent how we do things. Assumptions will change as we scale.
Build new data products that DC has never seen before
Communicate
Be the evangelist for your features and spread adoption
Empathize with your customers whether they are internal or external.
Document and train the cross-functional team on how to best use the software you’ve built to get more done
Through it all, you’ll listen, think, communicate and execute in a way that considers the company’s and customer’s process holistically. You are obsessed with quality, problem solving and creativity. You are a team player.

About you:
2-3 years of hands-on software engineering experience
Comfortable working with legacy code AND excited about trying out new technologies.
Our tech stack is currently python, pandas, flask, mysql, AWS, docker, kubernetes, and airflow. It’s constantly evolving.
Comfortable with some ambiguity and a willingness to iron out the missing details
Enthusiastic and professional
Startup-minded: you plug holes, get things done, and think of ways to improve systems
Flexible with the ability to work with a variety of personalities and types of work
Excited to be part of a team committed to making a difference in our country’s political climate
Compensation and work environment:
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Our workplace is both casual and professional, and we are committed to learning, fun, and excellence. We are an equal opportunity employer. This full-time position includes equity, health, dental and vision insurance, commuter benefits, flexible PTO, and company holidays.

How to apply:

","About StrongKey

StrongKey is making data breaches irrelevant. We are redefining the way businesses and government agencies secure their information against the inevitability of a breach through providing four specific practices that ensures their data, no matter the format, remains encrypted and protected at the highest possible level. While other security solutions focus on predicting, containing, or looking after the perimeter, StrongKey provides strong authentication, encryption, and digital signatures – underpinned by key management – to ensure data security, even with an attacker on your network. We’re trusted by some of the largest companies and critical government agencies around the globe, and we have tailored solutions whether you’re a multinational corporation, small business, or just you – working from your home office.

Founded in 2001, we are now at a pivotal time to grow. It’s time to capitalize on the success stories and proven track record around the globe, and it’s time to scale. It’s time to bring our innovative, affordable, open-source solutions to a market facing an ever-growing threat of cyberattacks.

This means a unique opportunity for people joining the StrongKey team. We can offer the autonomy, excitement, strategy-setting, navigating ambiguity, and challenge of a startup. And yet, all of that is backed up with 18 years of proven security, thought leadership, and a working business model. If you are tired of being lost in the crowd or feeling like you don’t have the opportunity for personal impact, we think we could be a compelling place for you to work. And if you drool at the opportunity to collaboratively create something new, we want you on board.

What You’ll Do Here

We are looking for a qualified Software Engineer to work with our Software Development and Support teams. Primary responsibilities include:

Lead Integration of Products

As we identify new opportunities for further product and module development for our products, you will help write and test new code.
Integrate software modules into a packaged application for installation and deployment on new computer servers for customers.
Work with specialized hardware and software (Hardware Security Modules, Trusted Platform Modules, and Smart Cards), and understand their integration into our products and services.
Maintaining Existing Code and Assure Quality

As new features and patches develop, you will maintain, test, and quality check existing code.
Develop documentation on complex cryptographic operations and identify how our products assist customers to comply with data security regulations.
Assist in building a testing environment that tests our products continuously. Perform testing.
Customer Support

Work with current customers to resolve problems with the product, troubleshoot, and put forth a strong and professional brand image.
Analyze error messages, track down bugs, and fix the errors.
Travel to customer sites to install and configure products. Work with our customers to install rack-mounted servers and configure the servers into appliances to perform specialized functions.
The Future of The Role

In the beginning, we’re looking to add capability to our current engineering team. As you learn how we solve problems and become more familiar with our products, we have several potential growth paths. You may find yourself in a more senior engineering position or a team lead. Or, you could work your way toward specialization (e.g., UX, web development, QA testing). Lastly, if you gravitate toward working with people, you could work your way toward an engineering sales role. Whatever your goals, we are committed to supporting your growth. And we believe we are a company who will grow alongside you, creating new and meaningful opportunities into the future.

Requirements

Computer Science degree (Master’s a bonus) or comparable field of study.
Courses, studies, knowledge or experience with Cryptography and Computer Security, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Advanced Computer Architecture, Database Systems Principles, and Server Web Programming.
Proficient with Java, webservices, Linux, and RDBMS.

And if you drool at the opportunity to collaboratively create something new, we want you on board.

The Kind of Person Who Would Enjoy Working Here

Knows how to communicate well in all circumstances, whether requiring directness, empathy, feedback, listening, or all of the above. We value the “human” in human capital a lot more than the capital, and we’re looking for people who feel the same way.
Can understand equally the challenges and limitations of engineering, while also thinking through how an everyday, non-technical person may interact with our product. Understands how to empathetically envision a day in the life of a customer.
Is equally comfortable chatting with a non-technical customer, as you are in a highly technical conversation with other engineers.
Is energetic, optimistic, creative, curious, flexible (we’re a startup!), people-oriented, comfortable leading, bold yet humble, and a passionate problem-solver.
Has a love of life beyond work! If you love board games, coffee, fitness, pub trivia, dinner parties, books, disc golf, or any number of other things you’ll be in good company. (And if none of that’s you, well then you’ll just add your stuff to the list!)
Compensation, Benefits, and a Bit More about Us

StrongKey is based out of Durham, NC and Cupertino, CA. This role is based out of our Cupertino location.

As an early member of the StrongKey team, you will be compensated with a competitive salary, benefits, and equity stake. You will also have the opportunity to help build a company from its early days and work closely with our co-founders. If you’re motivated by helping write a company’s story from the near-beginning, this is a powerful opportunity for you to join the ground floor of a company we truly believe is going to be meaningful.
