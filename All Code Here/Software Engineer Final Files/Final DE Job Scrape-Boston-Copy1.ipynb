Interfacing with project collaborators in-person and on-line is a key aspect of this position.)\\nLab Overview\\nThe Getz Lab has established itself as a world leader in the development and application of computational tools for the analysis cancer genomes. The lab specializes in cancer genome analyses which include: (i) Characterizing the cancer Genome, (ii) Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways, and (iii) Characterizing the heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer.\\nCharacterizing the cancer genome\\nCancer is a disease of the genome that is driven by a combination of possible germline risk-alleles together with a set of “driver” somatic mutations that are acquired during the clonal expansion of increasingly fitter clones. In order to generate a comprehensive list of all germline and somatic events that occurred during life and the development of the cancer, the lab develops and applies highly sensitive and specific tools for detecting different types of mutations in massively-parallel sequencing data. The volume, noise and complexity of these data require developing computational tools using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches to extract the signal from the noise.\\nIdentifying cancer-associated genes and pathways\\nNext, the detected oncogenic events across a cohort of samples are analyzed, searching for genes/ pathways, as well as non-coding variants, that show significant signals of positive selection. To that end, we construct a statistical model of the background mutational processes and then detect genes that deviate from it. As part of constructing the models, we study and infer the mutational processes that affected the samples (carcinogens, defects in repair mechanisms, etc.) and their timing.\\nWe have developed tools for detecting significantly gained or lost genes in cancer and genes with increased density or irregular patterns of mutations. Our work demonstrated the importance of modeling the heterogeneity of these models across patients, sequence contexts and the genome, when searching for cancer genes.\\nHeterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer\\nCancer samples are heterogeneous, containing a mixture of normal cells and cancer cells that often represent multiple subclones. We developed and continue to develop tools for characterizing the heterogeneity of cancer samples using copy-number and mutation data measured on bulk samples and now also analyzing the genomic material in individual cells. Using these tools, we can infer which mutations are clonal or sub-clonal, as well as estimate the number of subclones and their distribution over space and time. Correlating these analyses with clinical data, we can gain insite into the development of resistance during the course of treatment. We are now working to introduce these concepts to clinical trials and eventually clinical care.\\nCollaborative Science\\nMembers of the Getz Lab work closely with clinical researchers and in large collaborative projects sponsored by NIH (e.g., TCGA) and charitable initiatives (e.g, Stand Up to Cancer, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative) and industry partners. These collaborative efforts are significantly enhanced by the creation of data portals for the sharing of experimental data, analysis results and tools.\\nEOE / Minorities / Females / Protected Veterans / Disabilities</td>\n",
