We work with massive amounts of unstructured data, and we're constantly learning and building new ways to help our customers tell their stories with images from our photographer community.

Every team member touches every part of our code base, and we care deeply about fostering an environment that allows us all to teach and learn from each other, regardless of your role or area of expertise. Our engineers work closely with product owners and designers to understand our unique community of artists and buyers, and use that understanding to build highly scalable systems, software, and tools to make them happy and productive.

What you'll be doing

Write clean, well thought out and reliable code
Participate as a member of a small cross functional team containing members with different skills and experience
You'll work on big projects, small maintenance tasks, and anything else that makes software our customers love
Take lots of responsibility for your work as most teams don't have analysts, testers or system administrators

ABOUT THE TEAM

Interested in Machine learning, but more importantly want to get things released, not be stuck in the research stage for another 2 years? Want to get your hard work out, live into the hands of over 10 million people on a daily basis as they play your now Auto-tuned levels utilizing bayesian analytics and neural networks? Ready to do some ridiculously cool stuff that people talk about in white papers, but is only actually being applied in a few spots around the world?

Our small platform team here at Jam City is the powerhouse of the company and this role is truly unique. The team is brilliant: A PhD in physics from Harvard, the first person to hack the MacOS and boot up windows on it, ex-Apple project managers, PhD’s in statistics, among many other talented people. This is a place of immense resources and growth potential. Engineers at Jam City talk about topics like what it means to be conscious, or how genes are just an algorithm, so what does it mean to “be”. Point is, we have fun here, and we are looking for some like-minded, highly talented people to join the team as we ramp up our efforts in a variety of really cool initiatives, of which you could take ownership.
WHAT YOU CAN WORK ON
Content generation using variant auto encoders and ML, a truly top-notch data pipeline, and a warehouse of analytics that house trillions of events and is nearing a Petabyte of data, optimizing player experiences with cohorting.
We are making level editing tools, core systems that all game teams can bring into their project and use to immediately hit the ground running.
Pick something that you think you want to work on, that you feel will help the company, talk with the respective teams, and go to town.
Also it’s video games, which means it’s a very chill workspace, and we can try some really new, wild experiments quickly...without the fear of blowing up a rocket on the launch site.
Anyway, stuff is moving quickly here and we need help, so we hope to hear from you soon!
QUALIFICATIONS
Passionate and self-driven: If you feel you exist in the world to do cool stuff, and that not doing cool stuff would be a waste of your valuable time on this planet; good. We want people who are self-driven, because this team is very hands-off and not management-centric. If you are doing something that helps the company, good, keep doing it. You have to handle your projects from start to finish.
The most critical skill you can have is the ability to learn quickly and alongside that, the desire to learn. No doubt there will be new tech here that you have not heard of, that's fine! It’s up to you to read about it, and figure it out.
Interest in games. We are a gaming company and this team interfaces with the game teams every day, so it's critical to understand how the games work, as well as the psychology behind games, what makes them fun, etc.
You understand microservice architectures and how API’s are meant to be made. The intricate balance between a single responsibility principle and a tool that is generic enough to work across all our games and in many situations.
B.S. degree in Computer Science or related field; but if you are a Statistician who codes, that could also be useful, let's talk. (C#, Java, Scala, Actionscript, Javascript and/or Python with strong OO skills)
Good communication. You own your projects, which means you have to communicate what you are doing with our team, and other teams in the company.
NICE TO HAVE

In the U.S., we’re 13,000 strong, working together to positively impact every customer, organization, and community we serve. We achieve this by delivering on our values, putting people first, fostering long-term relationships built on honesty and mutual understanding, and inspiring the best in each other. This is all part of our inclusive, high-performing culture supported by Total Rewards that include our cash balance pension plan. Join a team that’s working to fulfill its vision to be the world’s most trusted financial group.

Job Summary:
As an Incubation Engineer, you will leverage emerging technology, methods, and processes to evolve MUFG’s work systems and technology infrastructure in order to enhance security, risk management, functionality, and end user experience.

As part of the Technology Strategy & Incubation team you will play an integral part in advancing MUFG’s technology infrastructure and be a part of a new culture of technical excellence.

You will be a key force in the evaluation of technology systems and platforms utilized by MUFG, identifying and evaluating opportunities for improvement, development and implementation of solutions that effectively realize those improvements, and ultimately transitioning those solutions to end users and operational teams. This position will allow you to use the breadth of all your talents: from partnering with teams across the entire organizational spectrum; to shifting your perspective and the perspectives of those around you to see beyond road blocks and unperceived inefficiencies; to conceptualizing, developing, and implementing robust technological solutions. Your skills in not only working and coordinating with large teams, but with actual hands on development and implementation of advanced and emerging technologies will be heavily utilized. As part of a team of extremely talented and imaginative technologists, you’ll be among a cadre of change champions who will both support and push you to the outer limits of excellence.

This opportunity is not for the faint of heart, however. As one of the leading change agents of technology within MUFG, you must balance legacy with cutting edge technologies, iron-clad security and risk postures with uncompromised end-user experiences, engineering technology with engineering people and processes. A refusal to accept the status-quo, confidence in your solutions and abilities alongside the ability to adjust and adapt if needed, as well as a ‘never give up’ attitude are crucial traits, as well as:

Demonstrate innovation and creativity in developing solutions to complex problems.Participate in project teams of 5 or more from both a member and leadership role.Ability to learn and use new and evolving technologies quickly.Strong security, risk, and end-user experience focus.Demonstrated breadth of understanding and development of solutions based on multiple technologies, including networking, cloud, database, and scripting languages.Strong organizational skills, with the ability to prioritize multiple work streams simultaneously.Ability to effectively work as part of a team or independently, as needed.Ability to overcome difficult and complex challenges and advance goals to tangible outcomes.
Qualifications:

If you’re still reading this, then the terms “cloud”, “automation”, “mobility”, “AI”, and “CI/CD” bring an excitement to you… even more so, knowing that these are key MUFG focus areas that the team is currently engaged with. Not surprising given that you’ve already had:
3 or more years architecting and deploying networking, infrastructure, and/or database solutions.

359,Data Scientist,"Redwood City, CA 94065",Redwood City,CA,94065,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,None Found,"Here in EA's Data Science group within Global Analytics and Insights, we're always looking for new members to help expand our horizon, to move our communal thought process. Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality. At EA, we live the “work hard/play hard” credo every day.

We are looking for exceptional people who share our mission: to reinvent how we measure human potential. At Imbellus, we build simulation-based assessments that evaluate how people think instead of what they know, for use by the education system and employers. We believe our society must prioritize developing minds that do what computers cannot. Eventually, we'll replace standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, SAT II, and AP. By changing assessments, we can reorient the education system & employers towards measuring what matters.

We love this challenge. We're an interdisciplinary team of learning scientists, game developers, artists, AI engineers, and data scientists, looking for others who want to tackle this difficult problem. We know that what has worked for decades in other contexts, might not work in ours, so we don't default to expertise.

Job Description:
JPL has a long legacy of operating missions around the solar system. Each of these missions generates large amounts of data, in many different formats. Unifying these data formats is a critical component in the successful operation of space missions. Data processing pipelines facilitate this information curation, which provides instrument operators with the data necessary to make decisions about how to proceed with the mission. Data science is the application of statistical methods to inform users of trends in their data. These techniques can be used in anomaly response, system trending, and greatly inform operators as to subtle trends in their system. Infusion of these methods into the operation of spacecraft is an ongoing effort at JPL.

This task will support the continued development of a data processing pipeline which takes data from across a spacecraft mission ground data system, and converts it to analysis ready data. By performing this translation, data is prepared to be stored in a long-term mission archive, in such a way that it can easily be used by future analysts to perform hypothesis testing and mission trending. Contractors involved in this activity will be involved in implementing the data translations, supporting the definition of database APIs for data storage and overall design of the system architecture. Over the course of the task, the project will also be developing user interfaces, for mission operators to interact with during their shifts. These interfaces will generate machine readable labels, to compliment raw data, which informs future analysts on how mission operators used the data during planning. Contractors will support the formulation of these interfaces, and their resulting data streams. Contractors will work with a collection of data scientists, spacecraft instrument operators, and science data processing pipeline subject matter experts during their task.
