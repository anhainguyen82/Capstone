       "      <td>Problem\\nIn the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.\\n\\nRoot cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it’s too late to fix the problem.\\n\\nSolution\\nDoxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated RoI of eliminating overages entirely and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.\\n\\nDoxel has taken the market by storm since it’s launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.\\n\\nTeam\\nDoxel’s team consists of some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley that include PhDs, engineers, business leaders and civil engineering professionals on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, graduates from Stanford University and with experience at organizations such as Google Advanced Technologies &amp; Projects.\\n\\nDoxel is backed by Andreessen Horowitz - famed investor that also backed Facebook, Coinbase, Slack, Airbnb, Github and Lyft.\\n\\nThe Role\\nDoxel is building a distributed infrastructure to capture physical data via LIDAR scanners. We’ll have dozens of robots running in the field, multi-gigabyte data uploads from remote locations, and large data pipelines process the data and applying cutting-edge computer vision ML techniques. Our customers expect fast data turn around and reliable reports. Your job will be to build the software that turns point clouds into insights for the world’s top construction companies.\\n\\nYou’re a machine learning expert that wants to push the boundaries of computer vision in the real world. You salivate at the idea of thousands of high-resolution LIDAR scans waiting to be trained on to teach our robots to “see” and identify objects on construction sites. You’re impact focused and not content with just theoretical results - you make sure your models actually work in the field (quite literally for us!).\\nResponsibilities\\nTraining and deploying models that automate our computer vision and robotics problems\\nWorking on object recognition from 3D point clouds, registration and alignment automation, and even robot path planning\\nWork closely with our Data Engineering and Computer Vision engineers to deliver accurate, reliable alerts whenever something is misinstalled on $100M+ construction projects - fully automatically.\\nUse cutting-edge CV deep learning techniques to solve the aforementioned challenges\\nMinimum Qualifications\\nExpertise in at least one of: C++, Python, Java, Go (two or more preferred).\\n3+ years of experience working with TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other mainstream ML framework.\\n1+ years of experience with deep learning on production-grade systems at scale.\\nExcellent interpersonal, leadership and communication skills, including the ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms and desire to work closely with end-users.\\nPreferred Qualifications\\nComputer vision experience, ideally with 3D point clouds from LIDAR\\nExpertise in C++ and computer vision OSS (PCL, etc)\\nContributions to research communities and/or efforts, including publishing papers in machine learning venues (e.g: JMLR, ICLR, NIPS, ICML, ACL and CVPR)\\nExperience with Google Cloud Platform hosted ML tools\\nWhy Doxel?\\nWe work on deeply technical, groundbreaking engineering work\\nWe like to think we’re more competitive and compassionate than most others - Muhammad Ali, Ayrton Senna and Vince Lombardi are our idols.\\nFiercely competitive, unshakably compassionate Intellectual honesty and radical transparency are core tenets at our company.\\nWe find that the trust developed in such culture far outweighs all else\\nWe think revenue is a trailing indicator of success - leading indicators are seeing our people get better at what they do\\nOn top of standard benefits package (medical, dental, vision, 401k, etc) we provide snacks, drinks, and free lunches in our office\\nWe believe in sharing Doxel success in the form of equity which is part of the compensation for all employees\\nDoxel is an equal opportunity employer and actively seeks diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</td>\n",

Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.\\n\\nThis is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.\\n\\nTeam-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.\\n\\nWe look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.\\n\\nGaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.\\n\\nWhat’s in it for you? Glad you asked!\\n\\nWe love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality.

       "1    Problem\\nIn the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.\\n\\nRoot cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it’s too late to fix the problem.\\n\\nSolution\\nDoxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated RoI of eliminating overages entirely and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.\\n\\nDoxel has taken the market by storm since it’s launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.\\n\\nTeam\\nDoxel’s team consists of some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley that include PhDs, engineers, business leaders and civil engineering professionals on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, graduates from Stanford University and with experience at organizations such as Google Advanced Technologies & Projects.\\n\\nDoxel is backed by Andreessen Horowitz - famed investor that also backed Facebook, Coinbase, Slack, Airbnb, Github and Lyft.\\n\\nThe Role\\nDoxel is building a distributed infrastructure to capture physical data via LIDAR scanners. We’ll have dozens of robots running in the field, multi-gigabyte data uploads from remote locations, and large data pipelines process the data and applying cutting-edge computer vision ML techniques. Our customers expect fast data turn around and reliable reports.
