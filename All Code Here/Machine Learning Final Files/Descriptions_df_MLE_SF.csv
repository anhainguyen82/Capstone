In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.

Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance.

Use cutting-edge CV deep learning techniques to solve the aforementioned challenges",None Found,None Found,"Problem
In the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.

Root cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it’s too late to fix the problem.

Solution
Doxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated RoI of eliminating overages entirely and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.

Doxel has taken the market by storm since it’s launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.

Team
Doxel’s team consists of some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley that include PhDs, engineers, business leaders and civil engineering professionals on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, graduates from Stanford University and with experience at organizations such as Google Advanced Technologies & Projects.

Doxel is backed by Andreessen Horowitz - famed investor that also backed Facebook, Coinbase, Slack, Airbnb, Github and Lyft.

The Role
Doxel is building a distributed infrastructure to capture physical data via LIDAR scanners. We’ll have dozens of robots running in the field, multi-gigabyte data uploads from remote locations, and large data pipelines process the data and applying cutting-edge computer vision ML techniques. Our customers expect fast data turn around and reliable reports. Your job will be to build the software that turns point clouds into insights for the world’s top construction companies.

You’re a machine learning expert that wants to push the boundaries of computer vision in the real world. You salivate at the idea of thousands of high-resolution LIDAR scans waiting to be trained on to teach our robots to “see” and identify objects on construction sites. You’re impact focused and not content with just theoretical results - you make sure your models actually work in the field (quite literally for us!).

Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality.

Triplebyte helps companies find and hire great technical talent. For any company building software, this is crucial for success. A recent survey of top C-Level Executives, across multiple industries, showed that software, R&D and recruiting technical talent are the top areas they are planning increased investment and budget over the next 5 years. Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s online technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.

We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 40 will double in size during 2019. Now is a great time to join as we're on an exciting growth trajectory. You will have lots of opportunity for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.

We have built Machine Learning models that predict the likelihood of an engineer getting an offer from a particular company. Interviewing and assessing engineering talent tends to be noisy, but our technical assessment has proven to be good enough to extract meaningful signals. We collect data on interview results and in-house evaluations, which gives us a unique dataset to play with. We've used that data to deliver a 40% conversion rate on our candidates at interview to offer, compared to the industry standard 20%.

Our mission is to create a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently route it to the best place, streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process, while removing human biases that can hold back some candidates.

Our Mission
We believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We're building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper.

Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like ""gut feel"" or ""culture fit"". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That's the company we're building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. Starting with software engineers."

****************
Our Vision
****************

We believe that time is the most valuable thing we can spend. We also believe that professionals are wasting a staggering amount of time at work because they have no idea where they are spending it. Previously, professionals had to manually record every six-minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. We are automating this workflow so professionals can concentrate on creating value, not being administrators.

And that's just the beginning. We will then leverage the data we collect to optimize the way work is priced and performed across these trillion-dollar industries. If done correctly, we'll allow professionals to output in 4 hours what now takes them 10. This gives you an opportunity to impact the world at scale - give people back time they'd otherwise lose forever and empower them to spend it with intention.

",None Found,None Found,"Picnic's mission is to structure the world's medical data to make it useful. We work directly with patients to collect, digitize,and manage their complete medical records, giving them with control over their care through a personal health timeline ( http://demo.picnichealth.com/ ). We also partner with biotech, genomics, and pharma companies who sponsor PicnicHealth accounts for research volunteers. Through this work we're building the data sets that power some of today's most cutting edge medical research.

ML at Picnic
Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.
