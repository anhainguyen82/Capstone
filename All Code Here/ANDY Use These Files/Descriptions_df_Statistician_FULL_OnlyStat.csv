IST Research Values

At IST Research, culture is a driving force and culture fit is a critical aspect of candidate selection and success. Here are the Values we subscribe to as an organization and if they resonate with you and you have the appropriate skills and experience, you’re encouraged to apply.
""Afghanistan + Burning Man""
At IST we do some really weird stuff. We are operating in parts of the world that no one else is operating. We seek teammates that can take off their western lens and operate as ""good strangers"" around the world. There is a serious focus on Hospitality in the Afghan culture that we want to embrace as we travel the world and welcome others to our spaces. Burning Man's self-reliance, civic responsibility, and participation principles ring true for us here.
""Sledge Hammer""
Be prepared to deliver impact like a sledgehammer; we do not work on easy problems or answer trivial questions. We are fighting human trafficking, battling propaganda machines, and bypassing oppressive regimes. The pace at IST Research is intense and we have found that it really isn't for everyone. These waters are deep, fast, and wide. If you can’t swim at the outset, you’ll drown. If you can swim, you’ll be fine-and you’ll get better at swimming as the time goes on, we are teammates counting on each other all of the time.
""No Other Room""
We often assume that our good ideas must, surely, not be original; that someone else must be currently working on the same thing and that somewhere there is a room full of very smart people working to solve this problem right now. Over and over we have proven to ourselves that there is no other room. We are the team that break open communications in the hardest to reach parts of the world and start conversations with the most vulnerable populations to improve their lives.
""Lewis and Clark""
Charting your own path is the name of the game at IST Research. As an extreme meritocracy, there is no pre-described career path here. Your path is the one you create through your own efforts and ideas. Our goal is to find teammates that are fearless explorers and then allow them to chart their own course. We function in an interesting combination of ambiguity and autonomy. We want you to chart your own path without fear of micromanaging. Blazing your own trail is not only allowed, it's encouraged.
""Addams Family""
Our HQ is in a big old house (might be haunted) in Historic Fredericksburg and the people of the company behave (and sometimes misbehave) like a family. We are diverse in habit and thought, but the diversity makes us stronger. There is much wrapped up in this value but think about the raw, honest conversations that happen around the dinner table, the unwavering support you get during trying times, the chaos surrounding large family events, and the fact that sometimes you just have to do some things that aren't your favorite but the family needs it done.

Deciphera Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients by tackling key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. Our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a “switched off” or inactivated conformation. These investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. We have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate and/or durability of their responses to treatment.

We offer an outstanding culture and opportunity for personal and professional growth based on these key principles: providing a collaborative, energized and fun work environment where people are empowered and supported in the achievement of their career goals a diverse and multi-disciplinary workforce dedicated and talented people who are passionate about achieving excellence in all they do a work environment that allows you to balance your priorities above all else, a commitment to the patients we serve
