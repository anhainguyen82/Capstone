We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.

Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.

Data Scientist (United Income)

Capital One is a diversified bank that offers a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small business and commercial clients. Ranked #127 on the Fortune 500, Capital One has one of the most widely recognized brands in America. As one of the nation’s top 10 banks, we offer a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. We nurture a work environment where people with a variety of thoughts, ideas and backgrounds, guided by our shared Values, come together to make Capital One a great company and a great place to work.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

On any given day you’ll be:

Using Hadoop and related tools (Pig, Hive, Impala) to manage the analysis of billions of customer transaction records
Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data
Integrating with external data sources and APIs to discover interesting trends (NOAA Weather Data + Credit Card Transactions = Fascinating!)
Creating machine learning models from development through testing and validation to our 30+ million customers in production
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of mobile banking and the financial world of tomorrow

Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea. You probably have a diploma and an impressive GPA, or you dropped out of college, taught yourself and routinely win Kaggle competitions.
Wrangler. You know how to move data around, from a database or an API, through a transformation or two, a model and into human-readable form (ROC curve, Excel chart, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.). You probably know Python, Java, R, Storm, Julia, SQL, Matlab, Mahout, or think everything can be done in a Perl one-liner.
Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. Expect to tell us what you’ve shipped and what’s flopped.
Fearless. Big, undefined problems and petabytes don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut.

Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it’s still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest folks you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.

We are looking for a high performing data scientist for our Quickbooks Capital business. QuickBooks Capital is a nimble and high-priority start-up within Intuit that is looking to reinvent small business borrowing and we are the team responsible for using our data to answer the most critical questions facing the Capital Product Managers. We are growing rapidly and need great people to generate analytical insights to understand our product and customers.

What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.

We are looking for team members that love new challenges, cracking tough problems and working cross-functionally. If you are looking to join a fast-paced, innovative and incredibly fun team go check out the product (quickbookscapital.com) and if you find this exciting, then we look forward to hearing from you!

Your Role and Responsibilities
Data Scientist converts business problems into an analytics solution using their consulting skills, business knowledge to analyze client business issues, formulate hypotheses and test conclusions to determine appropriate solutions methods. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure. This particular role requires deep knowledge and extensive exerience in Incentives Design, Operation, Data models and Statistical Analysis.

Our ML data science team focuses on the application of data science, statistics and ML to further advance MariaDB's industry-leading database services to achieve exceptional user experiences. This includes self-identification of workload patterns with leading indicators for stability, and prediction of incident likelihood, backed by robust event-causal models to deliver certain self-stabilizing autonomous actions or to identify a set of probable causes either behind or leading to certain database incidents.
The ML data science team has two (2) immediate openings for talents with advanced and intermediate data science skills plus pragmatic code development experiences. Both positions require one to work in a combination of data science and code development.
The first position is a senior-level role whose incumbent will be expected to have a deep working knowledge of data exploration, modeling, learning, and algorithm, while the second position is expected to focus more on code implementation but with intermediate data science knowledge and experience.
Responsibilities
The following responsibilities and requirements apply to both positions, differing only in the ratio mix between analytic and implementation work.
Assist with data and model validation, including identifying certain areas for further model optimization and enhancement. The work requires basic to advance knowledge of data science and data validation, thoroughness in analytic skills, criticality in thinking and reasoning, and at times, practical work such as setting up test databases to benchmark labeled test data. Some basic knowledge of database administration is highly desirable.
Design and implement new or model feature extensions for model expansion, including additional model and feature visualization techniques. The work requires reasonably robust to advance knowledge in statistics, modeling, in some cases learning, and excellent working knowledge of Python and its various related libraries. Experience in advanced visualization techniques is required.
Code and release some existing and additional ML models and data analytics into deployable and scalable cloud services with good performance. Knowledge of cloud services, cloud, and the full application stack is highly desirable. Experience and knowledge in good polyglot code and deployable patterns is a must.
Qualifications
Experience in CI/CD rapid development and deployable is highly preferable.

Who We Are
NT Concepts is a national security solutions firm that likes to solve hard problems. It’s our thing. We do that by working with some complex clients (you’ve heard of them) on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and experimenting with the latest technologies. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like to hang out with. Working on big data solutions is as much about the team you work with, as the data itself. Even more so, in our humble opinion.
Responsibilities
Why We’re Both Here - The Work at Hand
One of the most exciting parts of NT Concepts is our rapidly growing data-science team. You’ll be an expert for clients, partnering closely with our team of Developers and Data Engineers to create robust machine learning solutions. You’ll bring your skills to bear to solve complex problems, provide guidance on current and emerging technologies, and drive the future of our data science enterprise. We mostly focus on exploiting geospatial data of all types (because pictures and maps are fun!) with a sprinkling of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ve also got some really cool technology partners that add tools to your toolkit.

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
Qualifications
Who You Are
Beyond the whole “this person is awesome and I love working with them” piece, there are a few core skills that will help you out here.
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data.
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics. We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets.","Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
