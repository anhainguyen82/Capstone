       "23  Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) provides university, government and industrial researchers with access to several of the most powerful systems for high-performance computing, communications and data storage available to scientists and engineers nationwide for unclassified research. We advance state of the art high-performance computing, communications and data analytics. It is supported by several federal agencies, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a leading partner in XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment), the National Science Foundation cyberinfrastructure program. At any given time, we provide access to high performance computing resources for several thousand academic researchers throughout the country.\\n\\nWe are seeking a Director of Facilities Technology. In this role, you will be responsible for directing all operations for PSC high-performance computing and storage resources, as well as planning, design, deployment, installation, maintenance and operation of future high performance computing (HPC) systems. Current supercomputing resources include Bridges and Anton2 as well as the Brain Image Library and HuBMAP converged infrastructures (see https://www.psc.edu/resources).\\n\\nSuch HPC systems embody novel, innovative, state-of-the-art high performance characteristics not found in typical IT systems. Examples are high performance interconnects such as Omni-Path & Infiniband, parallel filesystems such as Lustre & BeeGFS, heterogeneous clusters with high performance processor nodes of varying capabilities including dense GPUs,, advanced job scheduling software requiring development of complicated scheduling algorithms, etc. Often these components are the first of their kind and require active collaboration with vendors beginning well before product release and extremely skillful problem-solving work just to make them work. PSC’s primary computer room is located miles away from the main staff offices and is run as a nearly “dark shop” with a single staff member typically on site.\\n\\nCore responsibilities will include:\\nLeading approximately 16 staff members, including system administrators; PSC’s advanced systems group, database information resources group, and staff that manage the facilities that house PSC’s large-scale systems report to this role.While staff is based within the CMU campus, the ability to manage a minority of remote employees will be necessary. You will advise the Executive, Center Directors and Chief Scientist in planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting and budgeting for the technology area of PSC.\\nDirecting upgrades, maintenance and ongoing operations of systems.\\nTaking an active role in initiating and preparing grant proposals to seek funding for future systems. Knowledge and ability to evaluate upcoming novel and evolving computing and file system technologies is critical. In addition to these hardware technologies, you will evaluate legacy, commercial, open-source, and locally developed software technologies.\\nWorking with managers and groups within PSC that are not directly connected to the technology area, including advanced networking, security, public health applications, and computational biology.\\nYou should demonstrate:\\nSupervisory and leadership skills\\nExcellent problem solving skills\\nAbility to balance conflicting priorities\\nAbility to communicate clearly and work in a team environment including working with vendors of HPC hardware and software and with representatives of other HPC centers\\nContribute directly to the planning and preparation of funding agency proposals for new HPC systems; advise and counsel to senior researchers and principal investigators on complementary projects\\nAbility to analyze a system, determine areas in need of improvement and implement solutions to improve the reliability, security and integrity of the system\\nIn-depth knowledge of and work experience with Linux and competency with other UNIX variants\\nScripting proficiency in Bash, Python and/or Perl\\nHigh degree of knowledge in administering HPC production systems\\nHigh degree of knowledge of data management software and parallel file systems\\nFamiliarity with grid computing software, advanced job scheduling software and other software systems needed in an HPC environment\\nAbility to recognize patterns of faults\\nAbility to contribute to preparation of funding proposals, annual reports, scientific papers and presentations\\nGeneral familiarity with Windows and Apple Mac OS X\\nFlexibility, excellence, and passion are vital qualities within PSC.
