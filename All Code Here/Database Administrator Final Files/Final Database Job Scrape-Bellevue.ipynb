The Analytics Group is comprised of the Analytics Consulting Team, the Enterprise Development team and the Analytics Data Operations (DataOps) Team. These teams provide solutions across UW Medicine, although specifically for finance, operations, institutional quality improvement, research and clinical analytics. The Analytics DataOps Team is responsible for the end to end platforms supporting the data solutions we provide for enterprise data warehouse, reporting, visualization and decision support.
