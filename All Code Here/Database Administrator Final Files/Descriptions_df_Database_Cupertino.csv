Why we exist
Services shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.
For organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.
To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.

","Overview
Though 9 in 10 Latino young adults say a college degree is important for success in life, fewer than 15% age 25 or older hold a bachelor’s degree. Voices College-Bound Language Academies exist to change that.
Founded in 2006 by East San Jose native and National Board Certified Teacher Frances Teso, Voices is a public charter school network with a mission to prepare all students for the challenges of higher education through the context of an academically rigorous dual-language program. With the Voices dual-immersion model, students receive 80% of instruction in Spanish and 20% in English starting in kindergarten. The percentages shift by 10% per year until reaching 50:50 in third grade. As a result, every student, regardless of home language, graduates bilingual and biliterate in English and Spanish.
In 2019-20, Voices will operate four public charter schools: Voices-Franklin McKinley (K-8), Voices-Morgan Hill and Voices-Mt. Pleasant (both Transitional Kindergarten - 5th, growing to Transitional Kindergarten - 8th) and Voices West Contra Costa (Transitional Kindergarten- 3rd). As we expand to serve more traditionally underserved students in Santa Clara County and surrounding counties, Voices seeks additional team members who share a commitment to its mission and believe joyful learning and world-class academic preparation are not mutually exclusive.
Voices Academies’ Vision
All students graduating from Voices College-Bound Language Academies will possess the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed in any career path they choose to pursue in life by mastering academic standards and subject matter. Students will be aware of the many positive possibilities for their future, and enjoy learning throughout their lives. They will be able to think critically by asking questions, especially when confronted with the status quo. Our students will have a sense of social responsibility to make their communities better.

Amazon is breaking new ground and changing the rules for relational databases. The PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is helping customers have enterprise performance, availability and durability, along with compatibility with the world's most advanced open source database - PostgreSQL. If you’re an engineer who is looking to grow, come on board! We have one of the most senior teams in AWS - and our senior engineers are eager to brainstorm, mentor, and get software built together. We built software, we patent new things, and we attend conferences around the world to learn even more.

Amazon Aurora is an exciting new area of innovation for AWS, and the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of Amazon Aurora is the newest part of it, built on one of the cleanest code bases in the open source community. The PostgreSQL-compatible version of Amazon Aurora is a new relational database which offers enterprise-class performance, availability and durability - all at open source prices - to our customers, along with the management benefits of RDS. We’re a relatively new team in Database Services, one of the fastest growing businesses within Amazon Web Services. We are currently spread across Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Sydney, and Dublin. Not only do we have deep database and systems programming problems to solve for our customers, but we also minimize the effort required to maintain SQL databases by automating administrative tasks like backup / restore, scaling CPU / RAM / storage and replication / failover for high availability, allowing our customers to spend their valuable time focused on building their businesses.

The Role
This position is on an exciting new team building a highly available, very scalable, high performance database offering. We have the need for low-level systems C programmers, mid-tier high performance C++ developers, and distributed systems Java wizards.

About You
You’ve built a lot of software – shipped products, created platforms, tools and modules, perhaps worked with every framework under the sun, perhaps made everything you have touched fast as lightning. You may have built big, distributed, API-driven systems with thousands of users, or systems for billions of transactions. You’re as excited as we are about learning every day, and solving really hard engineering problems that no one else is.

Passionate about software quality, repeatability, testability and maintainability, you are known to your co-workers as the go-to person for answers to questions that begin with the phrase “what’s the best way to…” – even though your answers tend to start with “help me understand what you’re trying to accomplish by…”. When you need clarity, you go to the product owner – or even a user – and talk to them until you get it. With stakeholders and other team members you are diplomatic, persuasive, and usually right. You understand the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in production, and your designs and implementations reflect that understanding.

When you’re wrong, you’re happy to learn something. You build software quickly, but properly (so that you don’t have to go back to it later). You know what “unit tests” are and don’t implement software without them. Shipping on time with high quality makes your heart feel warm.

Who are you? You’re the new Software Development Engineer joining us at RDS. We work hard, have fun and make history – want to come play with us?

What You’ll Do
Design and implement features for new and existing products, features, APIs, platforms and frameworksLead architecture / design conversations and code reviews (yours and other team members’)Work with managers and team members to estimate effort and clarify / negotiate / document scope and designContribute to design, architecture, process and development standardsEffectively mentor more junior team members, helping to maintain appropriate unit test coverage, code documentation, software structure and supportabilityArgue for the right outcomes with data, conviction and diplomacyIdentify, evaluate and suggest mitigation strategies for risks during design

Always be kind: a simple daily affirmation and one that feels more like a personal mission statement than a corporate motto -- but Pivotal isn't just any corporation. Underpinning our world-class capabilities in cloud-native software delivery and agile development methodologies is one common thread: empathy. Not only do we want to transform the way the world builds software, we also want to make sure that sustainable pace, kindness, and diversity are at the core of every enterprise.

Known for taking an iterative approach, our 3000+ employees are empowered every day to help shape the way we build software. Pivotal is committed to open source, a diverse culture ( https://content.pivotal.io/blog/diversity-and-inclusion-in-everyday-work ), and fostering safe spaces for all of our individual employees.

We are looking for engineers who want to make a lasting impact on our enterprise-grade database offerings, Pivotal Greenplum, Pivotal Postgres, and MySQL for PCF.

You
---

You are looking for a collaborative environment building database systems that enable enterprises to focus on their business rather than architecting open source database solutions from scratch.

You are a polyglot who loves learning new programming languages and systems. Furthering your education has always been a goal of yours. Pair programming is either something you enjoy or something that you wanted to try out.

You believe in relentless automation to simplify operating inherently complex things.

Contributing to open-source software makes you feel good about the transparency it brings to an organization's code quality.

Us
--

Agile concepts are at the core of our process. We have a whole host of Pivotal Practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives, and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation.

We believe in a sustainable pace, so we work 8 hour days, maintaining core hours to support collaboration. Although on-call rotations are part of most teams, incidents are exceedingly rare.

We pair in small teams of 4 - 8 people in our San Francisco and Palo Alto offices. We prefer to be co-located but when we do work with team members in other locations we use Slack ( https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/ ) to stay connected and screen sharing for pairing. We work hard to ensure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems.

Making an investment in each Pivot's professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage you to go to conferences, take classes, and read books -- and we'll give you a budget each year to do it.
