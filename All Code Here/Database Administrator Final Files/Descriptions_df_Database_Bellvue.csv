COMPANY

LendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.

Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.

What else you should know:

We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX43xCZV5j0 ).

CULTURE

We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, ""Get Stuff Done"").

Come work with us!
LendingTree is the kind of company that not only promotes diversity and inclusion; we thrive because of these values. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion (or creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or military status."

For example, missing deadlines could damage student career opportunities when providing recommendations for externships and residencies. The employee also must develop and maintain an institution-wide perspective when dealing with policy or procedural concerns and be able to make judgment calls concerning student, staff, and faculty matters, in addition to successfully addressing and resolving issues involving all parties.

UW Medicine’s Information Technology Services (ITS) department is a shared services organization that supports all of UW Medicine. UW Medicine is comprised of Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Northwest Hospital & Medical Center (NWH), Valley Medical Center (VMC), UW Medical Center (UWMC), UW Neighborhood Clinics (UWNC), UW Physicians (UWP), UW School of Medicine (SOM) and Airlift Northwest (ALNW). In addition, UW Medicine shares in the ownership and governance of Children’s University Medical Group and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (a partnership between UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research and Seattle Children’s). ITS is responsible for the ongoing support and maintenance of the infrastructure and applications which support all of these institutions, along with the implementation of new services and applications that are used to support and further the UW Medicine mission.


The Analytics Group has a dual report into both ITS and UW School of Medicine and provides operational oversight for the major analytics platforms and tools at UW Medicine, and is a key support function as UW Medicine transitions towards value based health care. The Analytics Group is comprised of the Analytics Consulting Team, the Enterprise Development team and the Analytics Data Operations (DataOps) Team. These teams provide solutions across UW Medicine, although specifically for finance, operations, institutional quality improvement, research and clinical analytics. The Analytics DataOps Team is responsible for the end to end platforms supporting the data solutions we provide for enterprise data warehouse, reporting, visualization and decision support. The platforms include Epic Cogito, Microsoft SQL Server, Caradigm Intelligence Platform, Change Healthcare financial support and reporting tools, BOE, and Tableau, with ongoing efforts to consolidate and simplify this stack.


The Analytics Group is seeking an experienced technology manager to fill the role of Analytics DataOps Manager (‘Manager’) in the midst of this transformation. The ideal candidate will have strong change management and technology team management abilities, with an excellent customer service mindset. Ideally, the candidate will have experience in ITIL/service management, application administration, Lean process improvement, Agile development and system consolidation. This Manager will need a high EQ and strong coaching abilities to assist in managing the many team changes throughout this process, with a minimal amount of disruption. The technical teams are highly competent, so technical direction is less critical, however the ability to ask good technical questions, challenge assumptions and learn quickly are vital. In addition, it will be helpful for the candidate to have a technical background in database management, reporting and visualization, cloud (Microsoft Azure preferrred), data delivery, and/or healthcare data.


This position will collaborate with the business and clinical partners across UW Medicine to develop solutions that will support analysis of financial, operational, and strategic activities. The Manager needs to work with the many different partners, prioritize requests, communicate status and progress, and work across the organization to solve problems. The Manager will need to work with the technical operations teams at UWM ITS and UW IT, and with vendors to identify improvements to our services and opportunities to reduce costs overall. ITS is moving towards more ITIL-based operational processes and the Manager will need to define internal operational and service level agreements, as well as improve processes to meet these agreements. The position requires creativity and the ability to suggest innovative solutions to business problems. The Manager needs to manage multiple technical teams to optimize the collection and delivery of data across the enterprise.

ITS also has a PMO, as well as Change Management and Release teams. The Manager will need to collaborate with all of these teams to align with their processes and demands. The Manager will also need to work with the many different business customers to organize their requests, communicate status and progress, set priorities and provide training. Finally, the Manager will need to support executive and operational governance groups and processes.

UW Medicine is in the midst of several transformational programs which are changing the overall platforms for patient care and financial management, and Analytics is an active participant in those activities. In addition, the Analytics team is embarking on the development of a modern data warehouse and pursuing a cloud strategy where appropriate. The future analytics platform will undoubtedly look substantially different from our current state, and there is considerable change occurring across the multiple teams. The manager will need to manage technical teams throughout these changes, while proactively seeking out opportunities for greater efficiencies and effectiveness.


Data analytics is a strategic function within UW Medicine with a large set of growing demands. The ability to deliver improved analytics, faster and at a lower cost is essential to both tactical and strategic success of UW Medicine overall. This role provides crucial support to UW Medicine and its partners for all of the major initiatives that require visualization or dashboards to deliver information to all levels of the organization and affect change.
