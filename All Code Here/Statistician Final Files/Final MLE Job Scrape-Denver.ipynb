       "      <td>DENVER CHRISTIAN ATHLETIC PHILOSOPHY\\nInterscholastic athletics are an integral part of a Denver Christian education. Denver Christian School is dedicated to providing a Christ-centered education that develops the whole child; this includes developing the academic, social/emotional, spiritual, creative/artistic, and kinesthetic/athletic. In order to glorify God in athletics, our athletes must pursue the goal of excellence within a Christian framework. The success of our athletic program is more than the outcome of a competition between two different schools; it means capturing every aspect of athletics (practice, traveling, competing, etc.) as an opportunity for learning, physical development, and discipleship. As Christians, we are called to excellence (performance to the best of our ability) in all areas of life because God rules over every area of our life … including athletics, and He has given us gifts to use for His glory.\\nATHLETIC GOALS\\nDenver Christian provides the opportunity for our students to participate in athletics:\\nTo help our students understand that God is in every part of their lives, whether that is in the classroom, on the athletic field, or in their home life.\\nTo develop physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, recognizing that each individual student is a unique creation of God.\\nTo provide athletic experiences where our teams participate in such a way that we honor our God, our school, our team, and our community.\\nTo develop our students into athletes who play fairly, observe regulations and policies, treat other with courtesy and take adversity without complaining.\\nTo demonstrate respect and courtesy toward teammates, opponents, and officials at all times.\\nTo help our students gain experience through athletic participation that will develop Christian character and reflect Christ to others.\\nTo help our students understand that our motto “TO GOD BE THE GLORY” is achieved when God is glorified through our effort, attitude, and performance. Our teams will train hard to win without submitting to the “win at all costs” view that is so prevalent in today’s culture.\\nCOACH EXPECTATIONS\\nAthletics is one of the many means of discipleship DC uses to bring students to a deeper relationship with Christ. Participating in a sport provides daily opportunities for students to grow in their walk with Christ by experiencing struggles, failure, success, and relationships through a Biblical framework. Coaches are the primary guide throughout this process. At all times, coaches should represent Christ, the school, and themselves in a way that honors God. Coaches are called to teach their athletes to do the same. In addition to discipleship, coaches must demonstrate excellence in their field and a growth mindset to be ever improving.\\nCoaches should have a clear profession of their faith in Christ and a discipling attitude about coaching/athletics\\nCoaches must have demonstrated knowledge of the game either as a player or as a coach; varsity coaches must have successful prior coaching experience.\\nCoaches must meet the requirements found in the employee handbook (add link to employee handbook)\\nCoaches must have a view of athletics consistent with the Denver Christian Athletic program, as outlined in this document.\\nCOACHES UNDERSTAND/AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:\\nAthletics is a ministry / discipling opportunity\\nStudents who participate in a sport are voluntarily placing themselves in your “classroom” for hours each week.\\nCoaches understand their sport is a platform in which to model and teach lessons which will last well beyond the student’s athletic career.\\nInvolvement in athletics, which by nature is a high profile part of the school, allows ministry opportunities with opponents, fans, and the community, as they observe how the Christian life is lived out in an athletic arena.\\nDC Athletics is an opportunity to teach Biblical principles\\nAthletics at DC supports it mission to “inspire and equip students of Christian parents to engage the world with Christ’s transforming power and love.”\\nCoaches may have more opportunities for discipleship than an average classroom teacher.\\nCompetition with lead to situation which parallel real-life situations.

These laws and regulations require Pfizer to provide government agencies with information such as a health care provider’s name, address and the type of payments or other value received, generally for public disclosure. Subject to further legal review and statutory or regulatory clarification, which Pfizer intends to pursue, reimbursement of recruiting expenses for licensed physicians may constitute a reportable transfer of value under the federal transparency law commonly known as the Sunshine Act. Therefore, if you are a licensed physician who incurs recruiting expenses as a result of interviewing with Pfizer that we pay or reimburse, your name, address and the amount of payments made currently will be reported to the government. If you have questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact your Talent Acquisition representative.\\nEEO & Employment Eligibility\\nPfizer is committed to equal opportunity in the terms and conditions of employment for all employees and job applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, gender identity or gender expression, national origin, disability or veteran status.

       "11  DENVER CHRISTIAN ATHLETIC PHILOSOPHY\\nInterscholastic athletics are an integral part of a Denver Christian education. Denver Christian School is dedicated to providing a Christ-centered education that develops the whole child; this includes developing the academic, social/emotional, spiritual, creative/artistic, and kinesthetic/athletic. In order to glorify God in athletics, our athletes must pursue the goal of excellence within a Christian framework. The success of our athletic program is more than the outcome of a competition between two different schools; it means capturing every aspect of athletics (practice, traveling, competing, etc.) as an opportunity for learning, physical development, and discipleship. As Christians, we are called to excellence (performance to the best of our ability) in all areas of life because God rules over every area of our life … including athletics, and He has given us gifts to use for His glory.\\nATHLETIC GOALS\\nDenver Christian provides the opportunity for our students to participate in athletics:\\nTo help our students understand that God is in every part of their lives, whether that is in the classroom, on the athletic field, or in their home life.\\nTo develop physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, recognizing that each individual student is a unique creation of God.\\nTo provide athletic experiences where our teams participate in such a way that we honor our God, our school, our team, and our community.\\nTo develop our students into athletes who play fairly, observe regulations and policies, treat other with courtesy and take adversity without complaining.\\nTo demonstrate respect and courtesy toward teammates, opponents, and officials at all times.\\nTo help our students gain experience through athletic participation that will develop Christian character and reflect Christ to others.\\nTo help our students understand that our motto “TO GOD BE THE GLORY” is achieved when God is glorified through our effort, attitude, and performance. Our teams will train hard to win without submitting to the “win at all costs” view that is so prevalent in today’s culture.\\nCOACH EXPECTATIONS\\nAthletics is one of the many means of discipleship DC uses to bring students to a deeper relationship with Christ. Participating in a sport provides daily opportunities for students to grow in their walk with Christ by experiencing struggles, failure, success, and relationships through a Biblical framework. Coaches are the primary guide throughout this process. At all times, coaches should represent Christ, the school, and themselves in a way that honors God. Coaches are called to teach their athletes to do the same. In addition to discipleship, coaches must demonstrate excellence in their field and a growth mindset to be ever improving.\\nCoaches should have a clear profession of their faith in Christ and a discipling attitude about coaching/athletics\\nCoaches must have demonstrated knowledge of the game either as a player or as a coach; varsity coaches must have successful prior coaching experience.\\nCoaches must meet the requirements found in the employee handbook (add link to employee handbook)\\nCoaches must have a view of athletics consistent with the Denver Christian Athletic program, as outlined in this document.\\nCOACHES UNDERSTAND/AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:\\nAthletics is a ministry / discipling opportunity\\nStudents who participate in a sport are voluntarily placing themselves in your “classroom” for hours each week.\\nCoaches understand their sport is a platform in which to model and teach lessons which will last well beyond the student’s athletic career.\\nInvolvement in athletics, which by nature is a high profile part of the school, allows ministry opportunities with opponents, fans, and the community, as they observe how the Christian life is lived out in an athletic arena.\\nDC Athletics is an opportunity to teach Biblical principles\\nAthletics at DC supports it mission to “inspire and equip students of Christian parents to engage the world with Christ’s transforming power and love.”\\nCoaches may have more opportunities for discipleship than an average classroom teacher.\\nCompetition with lead to situation which parallel real-life situations. Use these times to teach Biblical principles and encourage athletes to build Christ-like character\\nCoaches are intentional in modeling and teaching right character in stressful moments, when wrong character may be revealed.\\nDC Athletics views winning from the proper perspective - “To God be the Glory”\\nAll practices/contests strive to lead athletes to glorify God.\\nAthletes compete well, and play to win.\\nAthletes strive for excellence\\nWinning is measured in many more areas than just the scoreboard\\nA successful season is not dependent on the team’s win/loss record\\nCoaches view their teams from an eternal perspective\\nDC Athletics aligns with InSideOut Philosophy, promoted by CHSAA, which support our Christian Education-Based Athletics\\nInSideOut Philosophy focuses on the purpose, power, possibility, and privilege of leading and coaching\\nWhy do I coach\\nWhy do I coach the way I coach\\nHow does it feel to be coached by me\\nHow do I define success\\nAll coaches will receive a copy of the book, “InSideOut Coaching” by Joe Erhmann\\nCoaches will work on developing their own purpose statement\\nA DC Coach is a Role Model AT ALL TIMES\\nThe coach’s commitment to Christ should be evident to those who observe their lives\\nAt every practice\\nOutside of school/sport times\\nOn social media / communication\\nDelegation of responsibilities\\nMentoring team captains\\nThe coach is on display for athletes, parents, opponents, fans, officials, and the community\\nThe Varsity coach is especially seen as a Christian leader for assistant coaches, team captains, and other coaches in the program.\\nHEAD COACH CHECKLIST\\nPre-season\\nMeet with coaches in the program (MS and HS), led by the varsity coach.\\nCommunicate with the athletic director about a practice schedule prior to the first practice of the season\\nAttend and lead a pre-season athlete/parent meeting - (Explain expectations of Varsity/JV/C)\\nFormulate a list of policies and regulations for your specific sport which athletes should follow.
