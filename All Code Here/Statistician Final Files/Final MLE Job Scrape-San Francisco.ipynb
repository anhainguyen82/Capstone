We want people who are self-driven, because this team is very hands-off and not management-centric. If you are doing something that helps the company, good, keep doing it. You have to handle your projects from start to finish.\\nThe Ability & Desire to Learn Quickly: This is the most critical skill you can have on our team. No doubt there will be new tech here that you have not heard of, that's fine! It’s up to you to read about it, and figure it out.\\nInterest in Games: We are a gaming company and this team interfaces with the game teams every day, so it's critical to understand how the games work, as well as the psychology behind games, what makes them fun, etc.\\nGood communication: You own your projects, which means you have to communicate what you are doing with our team, and other teams in the company.\\n5-8 years of progressively complex related experience.\\nYou understand microservice architectures and how API’s are meant to be made. The intricate balance between a single responsibility principle and a tool that is generic enough to work across all our games and in many situations.\\nB.S. degree in Computer Science or a related field; but if you are a Statistician who codes, that could also be useful, let's talk.
