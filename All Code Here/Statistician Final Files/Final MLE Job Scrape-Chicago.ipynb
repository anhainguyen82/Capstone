Leveraging and integrating the University of Chicago’s considerable institutional strength in population science with research spanning diverse fields such as genetic medicine, cancer epidemiology, microbiome, and epigenomics, the Institute will have the common goal of improving human health outcomes. Another major goal of the Institute will be to develop a new multidisciplinary training program to equip researchers with emerging tools and methods to conduct precision health research within a population health framework. The administration and human resources for the IPPH is managed by the Department of Public Health Sciences. The Department of Public Health Sciences is the home in the Biological Sciences Division for the core quantitative research fields in public health: biostatistics, epidemiology and health services research. Our faculty both lead research projects in these fields and participate in interdisciplinary teams with faculty in other departments to address complex problems in health and healthcare, in our communities and around the globe. We provide training in these fields through two degree programs: a flexible doctoral program that may focus on any of our core areas and a MS degree for clinical professionals, designed to provide physicians and other doctoral-level providers with the methods to carry out rigorous research in clinical epidemiology and health services. Through our Biostatistics Laboratory we provide a collaborative service to investigators throughout the Biological Sciences Division to design studies, oversee data collection and analyze and interpret data.

       "4   The Quality Assurance Monitor (QAM) is responsible for ongoing monitoring of clinical trial data for local, investigator-initiated clinical trials, concentrating on data accuracy and completeness, protocol adherence, and toxicity and response review. The QAM work focuses on Phase I, I/II, and II protocols, and (s)he interacts directly with each study PI as issues arise. While the QAM reports directly to the CRO’s QA/QC Manager, this person is also responsible to and reports all findings to the Lurie Cancer Center’s Data Monitoring Committee. Ongoing review includes study participant registration, data submission and protocol compliance, toxicity review, adverse event monitoring, and response review. The QAM works directly with the study PI and statistician to provide data in support of publications.\\nPlease note: This person must wear a pager during work hours; work hours are Monday-Friday and must encompass the hours of 8:30-4:00.\\nSpecific Responsibilities:\\nProtocol initiation – Reviews new protocols, specifically sections relating to registration procedures, records to be kept, eligibility criteria, and adverse event reporting.

This unprecedented growth in the global urban population creates incredible opportunities but also intensifies the most difficult problems cities face, such as concentrated poverty, crime, poor-quality schooling, and pollution. The University of Chicago founded Urban Labs to help address these challenges. Urban Labs is a set of highly synergistic labs focused on undertaking inquiry and having impact on five essential dimensions of urban life: crime, education, health, poverty, and energy & environment. Urban Labs partners with cities to identify and rigorously evaluate the policies and programs with the greatest potential to improve human lives at scale. Urban Labs’ evidence-based approach gives policymakers and practitioners the knowledge they need to effectively achieve the greatest social good per dollar spent. In sum, UChicago Urban Labs: • Identifies promising solutions to urban challenges• Tests the most promising urban policies and programs • Scales-up the most effective and cost-efficient policies and programs.

       "11  Please make sure to read the job posting in its entirety as it reflects both the University roles and responsibilities, followed by the specific description.\\nDepartment\\n2013902 Public Health Sciences-Cep\\nAbout the Unit\\nThe newly created Institute for Population and Precision Health (IPPH), located in the Biological Sciences Division, will integrate a wide spectrum of factors such as human health behaviors, environmental factors, social and economic factors, policies and genetic determinants of health, into studies focused on the treatment and prevention of disease, as well as the maintenance of wellness. Leveraging and integrating the University of Chicago’s considerable institutional strength in population science with research spanning diverse fields such as genetic medicine, cancer epidemiology, microbiome, and epigenomics, the Institute will have the common goal of improving human health outcomes. Another major goal of the Institute will be to develop a new multidisciplinary training program to equip researchers with emerging tools and methods to conduct precision health research within a population health framework. The administration and human resources for the IPPH is managed by the Department of Public Health Sciences. The Department of Public Health Sciences is the home in the Biological Sciences Division for the core quantitative research fields in public health: biostatistics, epidemiology and health services research. Our faculty both lead research projects in these fields and participate in interdisciplinary teams with faculty in other departments to address complex problems in health and healthcare, in our communities and around the globe. We provide training in these fields through two degree programs: a flexible doctoral program that may focus on any of our core areas and a MS degree for clinical professionals, designed to provide physicians and other doctoral-level providers with the methods to carry out rigorous research in clinical epidemiology and health services. Through our Biostatistics Laboratory we provide a collaborative service to investigators throughout the Biological Sciences Division to design studies, oversee data collection and analyze and interpret data. This at-will position is wholly or partially funded by extramural funds (e.g., grant, gift, endowment) which is renewed under provisions set by the grantor. Employment will be contingent upon the continued receipt of these extramural funds and satisfactory job performance. If the position is eliminated due to the discontinuation of extramural funding, a minimum of one pay period's written notice (2 weeks) will be given or pay in-lieu of notice.\\nJob Family\\nResearch\\nResponsible for all aspects of research projects and research facilities.
