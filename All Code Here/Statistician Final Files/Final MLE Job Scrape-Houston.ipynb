       "0  Responsible for the application of standard statistical methods for conducting analysis and preparing reports. Will support study design, analysis and result interpretation for multiple epidemiologic and genetic studies of common complex diseases in humans. In the beginning of a study, this involves considerations of study design, data management and quality control. In the data collection phase, this involves interim analyses, and the presentation of reports of these interim analyses. As a study matures, this involves participation in the final analysis plan, the actual data analysis and the statistical interpretation of study findings.\\n\\nPosition Key Accountabilities:\\nConducts statistical analyses and reports.\\nVerify, clean and/or reformate raw phenotypic data for database storage and analysis\\nConduct epidemiological/genetic statistical analyses on large sample sets using R and specialized software.\\nSupervises the routing tabulation of data; edits and analyzes the final material in the form of reports and records, including detail and summary tables, graphs, and charts.\\nPerforms statistical analyses from both large and small samples of data.\\nCalculates medians quantities, percentiles and coefficients of correlation.\\nTests data for sampling errors and for significance differences between samples.\\nPerforms other duties as assigned.\\n\\nPreferred Certification/Skills:\\nProfessional competency in R or other scientific programming languages as appropriate to research focus.\\nFamiliar with Unix operating system.\\nWorking knowledge and experience in epidemiological studies, genome-wide association studies, and candidate-gene association studies.\\nGood communication skills both written and verbal.\\n\\nMinimum Education:\\nBachelorâ€™s degree in related field.\\nMinimum Experience:\\nTwo (2) years of experience in analysis and presentation of statistical data.\\nMay substitute required experience with equivalent years of education beyond the minimum education requirement.\\nPhysical Requirements:\\nExerts up to 20 pounds of force occasionally and/or up to 10 pounds frequently and/or a negligible amount constantly to move objects.\\nSecurity Sensitive:\\nThis job class may contain
