The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship.

The platform we are building includes proprietary developments in statistical fine-mapping; the application of cell-type-specific epigenetics data; population genetics; the use of predictive deep learning algorithms; and biological networks.\\n\\nSuccessful candidates will have a strong background in mathematics and computer science, together with some exposure to biology or genetics, and the personal and technical skills required on a large software engineering effort. Candidates should have a track record of developing sophisticated new mathematical or computational methods, ideally paired with experience working collaboratively on a shared codebase with other scientists or engineers. The ability to transition from academics to industry is a paramount requirement, even though much of our computational genomics work is experimental in nature. The successful candidate will be a team player, whose ideas and contributions are focused on the team's specific objectives.\\n\\nOpportunities for PhD-level internships on the computational genomics team are also available.\\n\\nKey Responsibilities\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\nWork on a small, highly collaborative team to develop the mathematical theory and software that comprise our human genetics analysis platform\\nDevelop new software (complete with unit and integration tests) in C++ and R, using git for version control and Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the computational infrastructure\\nDocument new theoretical approaches in LaTeX; contribute to writing manuscripts for internal circulation and publication\\nCritically assess current state-of-the-art methods in computational genomics; stay abreast of new developments\\nGenerate novel ideas to improve our human genetics strategy or the speed with which we implement it\\nParticipate in code reviews (as both reviewer and author); software deployment and testing; iteration planning and timeline estimation; and software design discussions\\n\\nQualifications and Education Requirements\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nYou must have:\\n\\nPh.D. in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Computational Genomics, or Statistical Genetics\\nRaw intelligence and an eagerness to learn\\nExperience working collaboratively on a shared scientific codebase\\nDeep programming experience in a mathematical or object-oriented language\\nCommitment to rigor, in both quantitative analysis and software development\\nExcellent communication and interpersonal skills (the role requires communicating about complex biological and computational issues)\\nAn understanding of major biological and/or genetic concepts\\n\\n</td>\n",

The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship.

       "9   Job Summary\\n-----------\\n\\nWe are seeking a creative and collaborative computer scientist, statistician, or computational geneticist for a role on our computational genomics team. The team is building a novel platform to identify the molecular circuits underpinning complex human disease, by combining human genetics data with our proprietary single-cell transcriptomics and neuroanatomical tracing data. The group is applying recent breakthroughs in proteomics, next-generation sequencing, network biology, epigenetics, and computational genomics, in order to map the genetic correlates of disease discovered from human genetics studies onto a biological network representing the gut-brain axis. The platform we are building includes proprietary developments in statistical fine-mapping; the application of cell-type-specific epigenetics data; population genetics; the use of predictive deep learning algorithms; and biological networks.\\n\\nSuccessful candidates will have a strong background in mathematics and computer science, together with some exposure to biology or genetics, and the personal and technical skills required on a large software engineering effort. Candidates should have a track record of developing sophisticated new mathematical or computational methods, ideally paired with experience working collaboratively on a shared codebase with other scientists or engineers. The ability to transition from academics to industry is a paramount requirement, even though much of our computational genomics work is experimental in nature. The successful candidate will be a team player, whose ideas and contributions are focused on the team's specific objectives.\\n\\nOpportunities for PhD-level internships on the computational genomics team are also available.\\n\\nKey Responsibilities\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\nWork on a small, highly collaborative team to develop the mathematical theory and software that comprise our human genetics analysis platform\\nDevelop new software (complete with unit and integration tests) in C++ and R, using git for version control and Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the computational infrastructure\\nDocument new theoretical approaches in LaTeX; contribute to writing manuscripts for internal circulation and publication\\nCritically assess current state-of-the-art methods in computational genomics; stay abreast of new developments\\nGenerate novel ideas to improve our human genetics strategy or the speed with which we implement it\\nParticipate in code reviews (as both reviewer and author); software deployment and testing; iteration planning and timeline estimation; and software design discussions\\n\\nQualifications and Education Requirements\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nYou must have:\\n\\nPh.D. in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Computational Genomics, or Statistical Genetics\\nRaw intelligence and an eagerness to learn\\nExperience working collaboratively on a shared scientific codebase\\nDeep programming experience in a mathematical or object-oriented language\\nCommitment to rigor, in both quantitative analysis and software development\\nExcellent communication and interpersonal skills (the role requires communicating about complex biological and computational issues)\\nAn understanding of major biological and/or genetic concepts\\n\\n
