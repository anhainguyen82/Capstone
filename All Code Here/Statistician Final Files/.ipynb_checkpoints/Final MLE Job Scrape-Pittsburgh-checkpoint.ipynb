       "2  Description\\nNaval Nuclear Laboratory is seeking qualified candidates to fill the position of applied statistician at its Niskayuna, New York facility. Naval Nuclear Laboratory provides technical support for the design, development, and testing of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Plants, and training of Naval personnel.\\nThis position requires an individual who will provide leadership on statistical issues, through collaboration and consultation with engineers and scientist across the laboratory. Areas of application include material science and engineering, nuclear reactor design, and manufacturing support. Experience or training in some or all of the following areas is desired: linear and nonlinear regression, analysis of censored data, variance component estimation, experimental design, and statistical simulation.\\nThis position will involve conceiving, developing, and applying statistical techniques to a wide range of technical problems, and promoting the understanding and application of modern statistical techniques through appropriate courses for laboratory personnel. Knowledge of Bayesian methods is required and a proficiency in at least one of the Bayesian software languages (OpenBUGS, JAGS, and/or STAN) is highly desired, as well as proficiency in statistical programming language R.\\nCandidates should have a strong interest in using statistical methods to solve practical scientific and engineering problems. There are avenues to publish new research in public journals, although these opportunities may be limited due to the sensitive nature of the work.\\n\\nRequirements\\nSenior:\\nMS degree in Statistics from an accredited college or university and a minimum of four years of relevant experience; or\\nPhD degree in Statistics from an accredited college or university.\\n\\nPrincipal:\\nMS degree in Statistics from an accredited college or university and a minimum of seven years of relevant experience; or\\nPhD degree in Statistics from an accredited college or university and a minimum of three years of relevant experience.\\nExcellent written and oral communication skills\\nKnowledge of Bayesian methods\\n\\nPreferred Skills\\nPhD degree in Statistics strongly preferred\\nProficiency in
