The fellowship is accepting applications for its third fellow, to begin in July 2020.\\nThis new program is designed to provide in-depth training to obstetrician-gynecologists in colposcopy and anoscopy techniques for female and male patients. Fellows will be trained in colposcopy and high-resolution anoscopy by experienced, credentialed faculty. Fellows will develop skills in the evaluation and treatment of cervical and anal dysplasia, as well as other complex conditions affecting the lower female genital tract.\\nThe fellow will have an appointment at the Associate level, will receive clinical and surgical training, and will provide inpatient (including Labor and Delivery) and outpatient services. The fellow will participate in patient care at Emory University Hospitals, Clinics, Grady Memorial Hospital, and other affiliated sites. Fellows will attend didactics and weekly Grand Rounds, and they will actively participate in teaching residents and medical students.\\nThe fellow is expected to be engaged in their own active research project, which will culminate in a presentation during the Department’s Resident and Fellow Research Day at the end of the year. Twenty percent of the fellowship will be dedicated to research time with ample opportunity for mentorship. The fellow will also have access to a team of researchers and a statistician to assist with their research project. If interested, the fellow can enroll in public health courses at the Rollins School of Public Health as part of the fellowship. Through the Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance, Emory also offers an NIH-supported Clinical and Translational Science Award that the fellow can apply to and receive their Master of Science in Clinical Research.\\nThe fellow will have the opportunity to be involved in international outreach and education around cervical cancer in Latin America. Specifically, they will be engaged in a cervical cancer screening program in a rural setting in Latin America early in the fellowship, followed by anal cancer screening program via high resolution anoscopy in the Caribbean or Latin American. The fellow will be expected to attend the High Resolution Anoscopy Course in order to become HRA certified. The fellow will be able to present at several meetings including ASCCP, International Anal Neoplasia Society (IANS), International Papillomavirus Conference, ACOG, and/or SGO. Finally, the fellow will have the opportunity to participate in clinical trials, specifically the Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR), Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) protocols.\\nInterested candidates must be eligible for medical licensure in the State of Georgia and be board eligible/board certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Salary and benefits are competitive at the appropriate PGY level.\\nFor consideration, applicants must submit an online application at the Emory University Career Website.
